<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This book makes no pretence of expounding
the doctrines of the theologian or analyzing
the methods of the artist. It is simply
a remembrancer of a quaint and winning man
for his intimate friends and parishioners; for
the boys who have delighted in his stories;
for the sailors whose lives he saved from shipwreck;
for the college students who learned
from him a wisdom not to be found in books;
for all, in fact, to whom the memory of his
unique personality is dear. With the story
of his life, with anecdote and reminiscence,
with selections from his speeches, sermons,
letters, and journal, it aims to recall Elijah
Kellogg as he really was: the boy, tingling
with life and full of fun to his finger tips;
the college student, genial, prankish, and
zealous; the farmer-preacher, devout and resourceful,
making pen and book, scythe and
hoe, seine and boat, all his ready servants to
do God’s work; the author, finding his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
straight to the heart of the growing boy; the
aged man, fond as ever of the soil and the
sea, and after all the rubs and chances of a
long life, still young in spirit, strong in faith,
and free from bitterness and guile.</p>

<p>Acknowledgment is here due to Mr. Kellogg’s
son and daughter, Mr. Frank G. Kellogg
and Mrs. Mary C. Batchelder, and to many of
his intimate acquaintances in Harpswell and
Brunswick for information relating to his
early Harpswell life. Special acknowledgment
is also due to President William DeWitt
Hyde for valuable advice concerning the preparation
of this book.</p>

<h2><a name="ELIJAH_KELLOGG_THE_BOY" id="ELIJAH_KELLOGG_THE_BOY"></a>ELIJAH KELLOGG: THE BOY</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">George Lewis</span></p>


<p>It is much easier to read the boy after you
see and know the man than it is to read the
man when you see and know only the boy.
Manhood may be the unfolding of the various
forces and dispositions of boyhood, but this
unfolding must take place before the boyhood
itself can be comprehended. The mill must
grind the wheat into flour and the flour be
baked and eaten before we can know how
good the kernels of wheat are. So we must
see Elijah Kellogg as a man before we can
fairly estimate him as a lad. When we hear
him preach or when we read some of his books,
then we know there was something in him
when a child more than mere roguery and fun.
Genius was there. Powers and faculties were
there which, when trained by judgment and
directed by piety, made him the preacher to
whom men and women loved to listen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
the writer of books that captivated the hearts
of all boys.</p>

<p>This man first saw the light May 20, 1813,
in a house on Congress Street in Portland,
Maine, where dwelt the pastor of the Second
Congregational Church of the city. The baby
was called Elijah because that was the father’s
name; and the father at his birth had been
called Elijah because of the famous prophet
in Israel who bore the name. At the father’s
birth it was said by his parents, “We must
have a prophet in the family.” So the name
Elijah was given to the boy and he proved
a prophet not in name only, but in reality
as well. The Rev. Elijah Kellogg, pastor of
the Second Congregational parish in Portland
during the latter part of the eighteenth
and early part of the nineteenth centuries,
was no mean representative of the old Hebrew
prophet. The famous name sat well and appropriately
upon the younger man. Had the
Rev. Mr. Kellogg lived in the days of Ahab,
of infamous memory, we may be very sure
he would have stood beside the old prophet
in his stout resistance to that wicked king;
and had the Hebrew prophet been born in
New England in the eighteenth century he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
would have sympathized warmly with his
young namesake as he buckled on his belt
and beat the drum for the patriots at the
battle of Bunker Hill, and put forth all his
skill and strength to free the colonies from
the selfish and tyrannical rule of George III.
There never yet was a true prophet of God
in any land whose heart did not beat warmly
for larger popular liberty and for a higher
type of righteousness. Every prophet looks
toward a sunrising that shall bring to earth
a better day.</p>

<p>Elijah Kellogg, Sr., was but a boy at the opening
of our Revolutionary struggle, but he was a
boy of high spirit, of dauntless courage, and
of most generous impulses. He derived these
qualities of character from two distinct sources.
These sources were, first, his ancestry, and second,
the neighborhood where he was born, viz.,
South Hadley, Massachusetts. A boy could
hardly be born and reared in the atmosphere of
Hampshire County, Massachusetts, especially
around Northampton and the Hadleys at that
period of time, and be anything other than a
freedom-loving patriot. It was a region of country
favorable to the growth of heroes. Settled
by stanch and sturdy Puritans, its people had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
for many years been sternly disciplined by the
Indian troubles. No pusillanimous and faint-hearted
men could by any means live long
in that section. Only men of courage and
strength could abide there. The Kelloggs
proved what stuff they were made of, for the
family had been living there for more than
a century when Elijah came upon the scene.
They were there when the regicide judges,
Whalley and Goffe, pursued by the rancorous
hatred of Charles II., sought an asylum in
New England. Those men came first to New
Haven for shelter, but even there they were
not safe from the emissaries of the king. The
protection, however, that New Haven could
not afford them, Hadley could. Among the
steel-hearted men of that up-river country they
found safety. In that region was an association
of liberty-loving souls, which, better than
woods and better than caves, made life safe
for those men who had helped behead a faithless
king and had thereby given the cause of
political and religious freedom a great uplift.
Some towns are vastly better for boys to be
born in than other towns are. South Hadley
was one of the “better towns,” where Elijah
Kellogg, Sr., saw the light for the first time
in the year 1761.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Furthermore, there was good blood in the
Kellogg veins irrespective of their geography.
They were a worthy race anywhere and in all
circumstances. Among the ancestors of this
prophet-named lad were men who had borne
the banner of the cross in Palestine with Richard
of the Lion Heart, and others who had been
true and stanch men in the Wars of the Roses
and during the great reigns of Henry VIII.
and Queen Elizabeth, and still others there
were who a little later for their conscience’
sake had come to America. With such an
ancestry as that and with a birthplace like
South Hadley, it is no wonder that we find
young Kellogg at Bunker Hill, where were
fired the opening guns of the Revolution; or
that a little later he endured the privations
of Valley Forge and fought at Monmouth.
He was, however, formed for scholarship
rather than for military life, and after the
war he entered and graduated at Dartmouth
College. In 1788 the Second Church of Portland
gave him a call to their pastorate. He
accepted the call, and after this time Portland
was his home as long as he lived.</p>

<p>Elijah Kellogg, Jr., had a good deal come
to him from his father’s side of the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
He also had a good deal come to him from his
mother’s side. This mother of his had once
been Eunice McLellan. Her father was Captain
Joseph McLellan and her mother was Mary,
daughter of Hugh and Elizabeth McLellan,
who had been among the earliest settlers of
Gorham, Maine. Eunice, therefore (Mrs. Kellogg),
was a McLellan of the McLellans. The
family were Scotch-Irish people, and were descended
from old Sir Hugh, who was knighted
in the year 1515, and the race was one of
strong family characteristics. Even at the
present time they are somewhat clannish, and
to this day throughout New England the name
McLellan is regarded by him who bears it as
a sort of patent of nobility; and all agree that
there are few if any names in the country
more worthy of respect and honor than that
one.</p>

<p>Joseph McLellan was a born sailor if ever
there was one, an adventurous rover of the
seas, always happiest when on blue water
with a good ship under his feet and a stiff
breeze blowing him along his course. This
man sent his own disposition down the family
stream, and gave to his grandson Elijah a
generous share of that same roving and ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>venturous
spirit. The story is told that on
the birth of an infant daughter to Joseph and
Mary the parents decided to call her Esther,
or as it was pronounced in those days, Easter.
The babe was taken to the church that she
might be baptized at the hands of the Rev.
Mr. Deane. At the font the name of the
child was handed to the clergyman, Easter,
upon which he broke out, “Easter! Easter!
That is no good name for a girl. Call her
after my wife. Call her Eunice. Eunice, I
baptize thee,” etc. The deed was done, and
the child was Eunice in spite of both father
and mother. The baby thus curiously named
became in due time the wife of Parson Kellogg
and the mother of the subject of this sketch.
The McLellans were a canny folk. They had
fought for Scottish liberty in many a sharp
tug with the Saxons in the old days. They
had helped fight the battles of the Covenanters
at a later period, and now in the
eighteenth century, transferred to America,
they still kept up the fight and played their
part on many a field, from Bunker Hill to
Yorktown.</p>

<p>Blood will tell. Family traits will be transmitted.
Sons will in some degree resemble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
sires. With an ancestry on both sides like
that sketched above, it is no great wonder that
the subject of this volume became the man he
did. He had a good start. There was in him
a goodly fund of inherited gifts. In the book,“Good Old Times,” which is Mr. Kellogg’s
story of the McLellan family (his grandmother’s
branch of it more particularly), the
author lets us see how largely his own personal
character was formed and his whole life influenced
by the traditions and stories of the men
and women of the family, recounted as those
stories were at the fireside in the winter evenings,
and told over again in the daytime as
men and boys were doing their work in the
woods and in the fields. The boy was perfectly
happy when listening to these tales of
pioneer life, made up as they largely were of
homely and commonplace incidents and yet
of really adventurous deeds. They were tales
of conflict with the Indians, in which the
McLellan fairness and good sense always won
the respect of the savages and in most cases
secured their good will and good treatment;
of encounters with bears and wolves and other
wild beasts, where man’s craft and skill gained
the victory; and experiences with cold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
hunger and hardships of the wilderness, in
which Christian faith and the McLellan pluck
overcame all odds and achieved a good measure
of prosperity. Things like these were the
folk-lore of the Gorham people rather than
stories of round tables and fairies and ghosts
and witches. This boy, like Carlyle, came to
have a great admiration for the “man who
could do things.” The ideal hero of Elijah
Kellogg’s early boyhood was the hearty, warm-hearted,
rough-handed, whole-souled pioneer
who never turned his back upon a foe, whether
biped or quadruped, and who never blenched
in the face of a difficulty or a danger. He
was the man who had in himself resources
that were always called out and brought into
exercise when obstacles were encountered, and
invariably rose superior to the obstacles and
made the man complete master of the situation,
however bad that situation appeared. As he
would have phrased it, he liked the man who
never got whipped. The white man who
could outwit an Indian or outhug a bear or
outrun a pack of wolves was a man to be
admired. The man who could fell a forest
and clear a farm and put the soil to the production
of corn and wheat was a man to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
admired. This hero of Kellogg’s childhood
was never entirely dethroned from the heart
of the man. To the end of his days he loved
that man who, using his own native strength,
could bridle and ride the storm, or over the
rudest billows of the ocean could bring his
vessel into port.</p>

<p>It is almost superfluous to say that the man
who wrote such books for boys as are the Elm
Island and the Pleasant Cove series of stories
was himself, when a lad, what would be called
to-day an irrepressible. Without the least
spice of malice or any suggestion of real harm
in his nature, Elijah Kellogg was as full of
mischief as a spring is of water, and it was simply
impossible for parents and guardians to
keep him within the bounds of Puritan propriety.
It weighed not one jot with him that
grave ministers and dignified elders of the
church were among his forbears. It never
occurred to him that because his father was
a clergyman therefore he, the boy, should not
go with other boys on Sunday morning to
enjoy a frolic and take a swim in the waters
of Back Cove, well out of sight from the parsonage
windows, though of course such things
on the Lord’s Day were strictly forbidden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Elijah’s proclivities were well known, and
many were the family traps that were set for
his ensnarement. But he had great facility
for getting out of scrapes as well as getting
into them. He did not, however, always escape
detection. On one occasion, for example, the
Sunday morning swim and games had been too
fascinating for his boyish discretion, and had
held him at the water until the public services
for the morning at the church had closed.
Elijah went home to meet his father, who had
missed the boy from his proper seat in the
family pew. That meeting between father
and son can be more easily imagined than
described, especially if the reader happens to
be the child of a stern Puritan church-goer,
and has himself been guilty of escapades on
Sunday. To the question, “Where have you
been this morning?” the boy replied without
hesitation that he had been to the Methodist
meeting. He heard his father preach every
Sunday, and he had become a little tired of
hearing one voice, and he wanted to hear what
some other man had to say. Of course the
next question was, “What was the preacher’s
text?” Elijah was ready for this and at once
gave chapter and verse and repeated the pas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>sage.
But the inquisition did not stop here;
he must now give some account of the sermon.
This seemed a perfectly easy matter to the
young culprit. He had heard a good many
sermons, and he felt very sure that he could
report one even though he had not listened
to it at all. But here he was caught. He
had never heard anything but the rigid, old-school,
Calvinistic doctrines, and it never
entered his head that one minister did not
always preach like another. It was therefore
a sound Calvinistic sermon that this young
reporter put into the mouth of the Methodist
minister. He was soon brought up short with
the paternal remark: “Elijah, stop right there.
Now I know you are lying. No Methodist
minister ever preached like that. Your whole
story is false. You have spent your morning
down by the water.”</p>

<p>When Elijah was some ten or eleven years
old he was taken to Gorham, and spent some
months in the home of Mrs. Lothrop Lewis.
Mrs. Lewis had a young daughter whom she
wished put into a Portland school, and an exchange
of children was made with the Kelloggs,
they taking the girl into their home and Mrs.
Lewis taking the boy into hers. This exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
was in many respects a grateful one to the boy.
The country was the place for him. There
was more freedom there, more room and more
chance for fun than in town. Perhaps, too,
the fact that his father was nine miles away
had its alleviations, for the presence of a
father, however dearly he was loved, was a
damper on the spirit of prankishness. While
with Mrs. Lewis, Elijah certainly made mischief
for everybody, but at the same time he
made friends of everybody, for none could help
loving the bright and lively fellow. In due
time the boy went back to Portland. But the
city was no place for a lad like him. He
chafed under its restraints, and cared but little
for its schools. He was like a sea-gull shut
up in a cage. As the imprisoned gull pines
for the freedom of wind and wave so did the
heart of Elijah Kellogg long for the free winds
and the rolling waters and the ships that went
sailing away to distant ports. It was a longing
that could not be suppressed, and no one
can really blame him that before he was thirteen
years old he had found his way on board
a ship and become a sailor in downright earnest.
I am sure that the boys who read his
books are not sorry that the hand that wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
those stories gained some of its cunning by
pulling ropes, furling and unfurling sails, taking
his trick at the wheel, and sharing actively
in whatever pertained to the handling and
management of vessels. He loved the sea, and
was fascinated by the strange sights and sounds
of foreign countries. He was a keen observer
for a boy just entering his teens, and he gained
much valuable knowledge as he wandered
round the world borne along by the wings of
a ship. But in his roving he never for one
moment forgot his home. His heart was warm
and true to the friends who were there. Letters
written to his father from different quarters
of the world are now in existence, and they
bear full testimony to his ardent affection for
home and friends. His love for friends was
perhaps the strongest element of his nature,
even stronger than his love of adventure, and
in due time that love brought him back from
his travels no longer to sail the seas except in
small boats near the shore. In the story of “Charlie Bell,” Mr. Kellogg (unconsciously,
no doubt) has given us the picture of a boy’s
nature and disposition very much like his own.</p>

<p>After returning from sea Elijah found Portland
and Portland ways no more congenial to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
him than they had been before he went away,
and again he left home and went to Gorham
to try life among his McLellan relatives. He
lived for a time in the family of Major Warren
on a farm some two miles out of the village,
matching his own strength of muscle with that
of the regular farm-hands. He was not there
a great while, however. Rev. Mr. Kellogg
came out from Portland and interviewed Mr.
Alexander McLellan, a near relative of his own
wife, and the result of that interview was that
Elijah was, after the fashion of the time, indentured
as an apprentice to Mr. McLellan to
do general work on the place for the period of
one year. The purpose of this indenture, however,
was rather to restrain and hold him in
one stated place than to make a servant of
him, for he became at once a true member of
the family “in good and regular standing.”
He took his position and did his share of the
work on the place in a faithful and orderly
manner. His experience on the ship had been
of great benefit to him. He had there learned
the lessons of obedience and of industry,&mdash;lessons
absolutely essential for every boy to learn
if he would ever arrive at a worthy maturity.
Now, instead of blocks and ropes and belaying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
pins, his tools were the plough, the hoe, the
scythe, and the axe, and while using these he
could almost fancy himself a pioneer. All this
was a very wholesome kind of life and a right
life in its way. Still it was no proper life for
such a young man as by this time Elijah Kellogg
had become. All his friends seemed to
feel the incongruity of it, and the truth of this
began to dawn upon himself, also. He began
to feel, and to feel very strongly, that this sort
of life was not up to his own level. The bird
is for a life higher than the ground, and in like
manner he was for something higher than the
farm. There was a real genius in the soul of
this boy that was reaching up toward intellectual
exercises. Decks of ships, fields of corn,
loads of lumber, were all good, but for him
there was something better. The play of intellect
appealed to him now more than the play
of muscle did. All the associations in the
family where he lived and those throughout
the village were such as to encourage and foster
this new ambition. This new feeling, this
new ideal which was fast taking possession of
his mind, was only an indication that the doors
of boyhood were closing and the doors of manhood
were beginning to open. He was grad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>ually
coming to understand himself and to have
a dawning perception of some God-given powers,
which, if they were properly trained, might
result in the accomplishment of fine things.
This vision of what he might sometime perform,
if he would, rose to the front, and for
the time assumed the leadership of his life.
He was as obedient to this vision as Saint Paul
was obedient to the vision he had near the
city of Damascus, or as Abraham Lincoln was
obedient to those dreams and visions that he
had while he was managing the flatboat on
the great river. The McLellan family, where
he was living, were heartily in sympathy with
this new development. From oldest to youngest
they all felt that it was not a proper thing
that this young man who was so gifted and
who showed so many marks of a true genius
should spend his energies on the farm and in
the shop. There is iron for the place of iron
and steel for the place of steel and silver for
that of silver. This was a piece of silver, and
he ought to take his proper place. It is needless
to say how much this <i>change of aim</i> on
the part of Elijah gladdened the heart of his
own father. It was indeed a day of general
thanksgiving when this young man put him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>self
in the way of a higher intellectual development
and entered Gorham Academy as one
of its students. This was one of the best
academies in the country at that day. Its
presiding genius was Master Nason who was
known far and wide, not only as one who
could keep rude boys in subjection to school
rules by a liberal use of the birch, but as one
who possessed faculty and power to stir the
minds of pupils and impart to them rich stores
of knowledge. New England has seen few
instructors equal to Master Nason. The names
of boys whom, in the old Academy at Gorham,
he fitted for college, have in several instances
become known all over the country, and some
are known round the world. The Academy is
proud of its roll of graduates, and those who
studied under Mr. Nason have always been
proud of their teacher.</p>

<p>Young Kellogg now put himself squarely
down to hard work. He was older than are
most boys when they take up the higher
branches of study and begin to point their
way definitely toward college, and he studied
and worked in the Academy like one who is
trying to make up for lost time. Such an
intensity of application to books as was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
at this time would have broken down many
students; but Kellogg had a rare stock of good
health and physical strength. He could well
stand the strain of hard study. He had a well-knit
frame. He never forgot how much of
his own power of endurance he derived from
his sturdy habits of toil in field and forest.
He never forgot what a good physical basis
for intellectual work manual labor gives one.
In one of the college boys of his creation in
the Whispering Pine series of books&mdash;Henry
Morton&mdash;he shows the close connection between
that young man’s hoe and axe and his
leadership of the college class. When Mr.
Kellogg did this, he knew very well what he
was talking about. Seventy years ago these
things largely took the place of the athletic
field of our time, and they filled that place
very well, too. An old fogy may perhaps be
pardoned for saying that in spite of all the
excitement and glory of base-ball and foot-ball
and running and leaping and boating, still the
oil of hoe handle has its virtues as a medicine
for students.</p>

<p>The life of young Kellogg shows distinctly
two points of turning. The first one was when
he wakened to the consciousness of his mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
powers; when he realized something of what
he was and determined that he would live on
the high level of his intellectual self. A young
horse that has in him the elements of speed to
win a race on the track is trained for the track.
The horse of great weight is put into the truck
team. Animals are put in training, according
to what they are. When Kellogg realized
something of his own intellectual power, then
he put himself in training for an intellectual
life. He therefore went into the Academy
that he might fit for college. After he had
begun work in the Academy there came to him
another consideration, and he asked the question: “Is a life of mere scholarship the highest
and best one of which I am capable?” He felt
surely that he ought to live up to the level
of his mind, but he began to feel that there
was some power in himself superior to that
of brains and that that higher power should
be developed and his own life should be devoted
to that which was supreme. He felt
strongly that he should not allow the spiritual
element of his nature to lie dormant or go to
waste. The diamond that is not ground on
the wheel is just as hard as the one that is
ground, but it does not sparkle and flash like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the one on which the lapidary has spent his
skill. The uncut diamond is like the man
who stops in the classical school and does not
care for the infinitely finer work that religion
does for him. Mr. Kellogg felt that it was
not enough for him to have power. The power
that was in him should be dedicated to the divinest
ends. It should be religiously dedicated
and consecrated. This was the second turning
of his life, and when it was made he had
become an earnest and devoted Christian. He
understood Christianity to mean that he should
employ the faculties and powers of his own
nature in helping other people to lead better
and more wholesome lives. Christianity meant
more than self-culture; it meant self-giving.
If there was in himself (as there certainly was)
a large element of fun, this was by no means
to be suppressed or sent into eclipse. Religion
would not maim him that way any more than
religion would clip the wings of a robin and
make a mole of the bird. But religion would
take that spirit of fun and cause it to play
and shine and work for the production of purer
thinking and cleaner living and higher aiming
among all young people.</p>

<p>It was in obedience to this new spirit that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Elijah went to work at once outside of the
Academy as well as in it, and he then started
some streams of religious influence that have
by no means ceased running even to this day.
Among the things he did at this period was
to go into a certain neighborhood not many
miles from Gorham and start a Sunday-school.
It seems easy enough to <i>say</i> that the young
man went into a certain place and organized
a Sunday-school, but from all accounts it was
by no means an easy or even a safe thing for
that young man to do. Three score and odd
years ago&mdash;long before the days of Neal Dow
and the Maine Law&mdash;there were certain
regions here and there in the State where
those people who were ignorant and given to
drink and other forms of vice were sure to
congregate like birds of ill omen, and there
would be a neighborhood from which respectable
people would keep away. Such a community
was a multiplied Ishmael whose hand
was against every man and every man’s hand
against it. On one of these disreputable districts
Elijah’s attention became fixed. With
two or three of the people who lived there he
had in some way become acquainted, and he “felt a call” to preach in that place. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
even Elijah Kellogg, young, brave, and stout-hearted
as he was, shrank from going there
alone with an invitation to a Sunday-school
to be sent abroad among that class of folk.
He feared what might come from such a movement,
and wished for a companion to share
his fortunes. He appealed to a young friend,
George L. Prentiss, afterward for many years
an honored professor in Union Theological
Seminary in New York, to go with him. But
the response of Prentiss to this request was
not favorable. “No, Elijah,” was his word,“I don’t dare to go down there. They will
kill us if we do.” Then after a moment’s
pause, “I’ll tell you what I will do. If you
go down there and start a Sunday-school and
don’t get killed, I’ll come in later and help
you.” But Elijah had set his heart on doing
the bit of work, and was not to be scared out
of it. He started on his mission alone, and I
doubt if Judson on his way to India, or Livingstone
going to Africa, did a more heroic
thing than that. He did start a Sunday-school,
and he did get the people interested in both
himself and his school, and through his influence
the community was transformed, and to-day
the descendants of those people are an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
intelligent, God-fearing, church-going, high-minded
class of citizens, and they are such because
of Mr. Kellogg. He never forgot them,
and they never forgot him. The writer of
this article was present in company with Mr.
Kellogg at the fiftieth anniversary of the inauguration
of that school. The season was
mid-summer. The day was Sunday. The
place was the church. The audience was everybody
who lived in the district, supplemented
by a large number who had driven thither from
Portland, Westbrook, Gorham, Scarboro, and
Saco. The larger share of those who had
gathered were not able to get inside the church,
but they crowded as close to the wide open
windows as possible and heard what they could.
After brief introductory exercises, Mr. Kellogg
preached a most beautiful and touching sermon
of some twenty minutes’ length. Then the
Bible was closed, and a period of story-telling
began. There were present some four or five
persons who remembered the “first day of
school” fifty years before. They all talked.
Reminiscences were called up, old scenes revived,
old stories told, old experiences related,
and the old time was contrasted with the new.
It was all of it immensely funny. Sometimes it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
was crying, but a good deal more it was laughing.
My own feeling at the moment was that
it was fortunate the windows were open, for
otherwise the house must have burst. I do
not think there ever was another church than
that since churches were built where was heard
so much laughter and manifested so much fun
and wit on Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. Kellogg got through with the Academy,
and entered Bowdoin College in 1836. It is
worthy of note that in all his long life he
never shuffled off the boy. It was not a mere
memory on his part that he once was a boy.
The genuine boy was never a memory with
him, but was always a present reality. In one
sense he was as young at eighty as he was at
eighteen. Boys were his mates always. There
are men who, like Oliver Wendell Holmes, never
grow old, and Mr. Kellogg was one of them.
To the very last his lips would smile and his
eyes would twinkle as he recalled some prank

<h2><a name="COLLEGE_AND_SEMINARY" id="COLLEGE_AND_SEMINARY"></a>COLLEGE AND SEMINARY</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Henry Leland Chapman</span></p>


<p>It was in 1836, in the twenty-fourth year of
his age, that Elijah Kellogg entered Bowdoin
College as a Freshman. His father had been
one of the earliest and firmest friends of the
college. As one of the Cumberland County
Association of Ministers he had joined in the
petition to the General Court of Massachusetts
for the establishment of a collegiate institution
in the province of Maine. When in answer
to the petition of the ministers, and of
the Court of Sessions of Cumberland County,
the college was incorporated in 1794, Mr.
Kellogg was named as one of the first board
of overseers. Four years later he became a
trustee, and continued to hold that official
relation to the college until 1824. During
his boyhood, therefore, and before he cherished
any purpose or desire to enjoy its privileges,
Elijah must have heard, within the family cir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>cle,
much about the college which was so great
an object of interest and pride to his father,
as it was, indeed, to the whole community.
It was but natural, therefore, when his purpose
was seriously formed to seek a college
training in preparation for his father’s calling
of the ministry, that Bowdoin, aside from its
proximity to his home, should be the college
of his choice. But his course collegeward was
interrupted and delayed by various circumstances,
and particularly by personal tastes
that were quite other than scholastic. Always
a lover of the sea, and delighting in the tales
of sea life and adventure to which he listened
from the lips of sailors themselves along the
Portland wharves, it is not strange that the
call of the sea sounded louder than any other
in his ears. So, listening to the call, he shipped
before the mast, and for three years lived
the hard and perilous life of a sailor. It is
true that the experience, which may have been
useful to him in other ways also, was an admirable
preparation for the brilliant service
which he afterwards performed as chaplain
of the Sailor’s Home in Boston, but in the
meantime it made him late in entering upon
his college life. It is to be said, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
that of his thirty classmates six were as old
as himself.</p>

<p>We must look to certain volumes of the
Whispering Pines series, and particularly to
the volumes entitled “The Spark of Genius,” “The Sophomores of Radcliffe,” and “The
Whispering Pine,” for a picture of his college
life, true in its general features, and graphic
like everything from Mr. Kellogg’s pen. These
books, which have been read with eager interest
by so many generations of boys, describe
Bowdoin College, its professors, students, customs,
and manners as they were known to Elijah
Kellogg during the years of his residence
there from 1836 to 1840. If they seem to be
devoted largely to a recital of pranks and mischief
and practical jokes among the students,
it is partly because such things made a stronger
appeal to scheming brains, and youthful fellowship,
and leisure hours in those days, before athletic
sports enlisted, as they have since enlisted,
the restless energy and high spirits and intense
rivalry of college boys; and partly, also, it was
because his native sense of humor and love of
fun, his spirit of adventure and personal courage,
constituted an ever present temptation to
him to share or lead in enterprises which de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>manded
wariness and cunning and pluck, and
which promised the discomfiture of some boastful
and unloved fellow-student, or the perplexed
disapproval of the college authorities,
or the entertainment of a college community
always keenly appreciative of a diverting
sensation. So alive was he to this phase of
student activity, and so conspicuous was he
among his mates for resourcefulness and courage,
that he became, in the popular opinion
of his time and in subsequent tradition, the
hero of many an escapade with which he had
no connection. One instance, however, of
strenuous effort quite outside his college duties
seems to be well authenticated, and will
serve to show the kind of mischievous exploit
which was attractive enough to enlist his cooperation.</p>

<p>The president of the college during the first
three years of Kellogg’s course was a man of
great dignity and reserve. He held himself
quite aloof from the students, neither inviting
nor allowing any freedom of social intercourse.
Partly on this account he was unpopular with
the student body, and the solemn reserve in
which he intrenched himself seemed, in their
eyes, to make any infringement, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
slight, of his personal dignity particularly humorous.
There was much irreverent laughter,
therefore, when it was whispered about on one
occasion that the silk hat which the president
was accustomed to wear, and which seemed
the very crown and symbol of his formal stateliness,
had been stolen, and was in the hands
of some of the students. When it came to
the ears of Kellogg he remarked that if he
knew the boys that had the hat he would put
it on the top of the chapel spire. Of course
the interesting information was not long withheld
from him, and in the darkness of a showery
night he climbed sturdily up by the slender
and insecure pathway of the lightning-rod,
and placed the hat on the very top, where, in
the morning, it met the dismayed vision of
the president, and received the boisterous salutations
of the college. That was Kellogg’s
contribution to the deed of mischief. To
steal the hat was a petty and foolish trick,
such as might be perpetrated by a half-witted
person, a coward, or a thief; but to carry it
through the darkness to the top of the chapel
spire required a clear head, a stout heart, good
muscle, and nerve, and these Elijah Kellogg
possessed, both in youth and manhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>In reading these books, which tell the substantial
history of his life at Bowdoin, it is
quite evident that, with all the interest he
took in the pastimes and pranks of his associates,
he was not unmindful of the high and
serious purpose of a college course. He maintained
a consistent ideal of personal integrity
and helpfulness and truth. It is the repeated
testimony of those who were in college with
him that his influence upon his fellow-students
was in a high degree stimulating and wholesome. “He was,” says one who knew him
well in the intimacy of college association, “universally popular, but he had his own
chosen favorites, and one characteristic of
him was his strong personal affection for them.
His soul burned with love to those whom he
loved. This was one secret of his power for
good, for his influence upon them was always
good.” An unaffected scorn of what was mean
or false, and an eagerness to recognize and to
make the most of every good and generous
trait in his companions, were as characteristic
of him as was his light-hearted, fun-loving disposition,
and it is easy to see why he won
both the respect and love of those who were
admitted to his friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>These engaging qualities of his youth were
no less those of his age, and they made him
throughout life the friend of boys and the
favorite of boys. He never lost the spirit of
sympathy and comradeship with young men,
and as his home, during the later years of
his life, was not far from the college that he
loved, he had a double motive to revisit, from
time to time, the scene of those labors and
frolics and friendships which he had so charmingly
depicted in the Whispering Pine books.
Accordingly he presented himself, now and
then, either unexpectedly or upon invitation,
at the door of some undergraduate member of
his college fraternity, the Alpha Delta Phi,
and became, for as long as he would stay, a
welcome and honored guest.</p>

<p>It did not take long for the news to spread
that Elijah Kellogg was in college; and then
the hospitable room would be visited by many
callers, eager to greet the shy, weather-beaten
little man, whose heart was always warm for
boys, and even the mazy wrinkles of whose
face seemed to speak less of age than of kindness.
And by the evening lamp an interested
circle of students forgot the morrow’s lessons
as they listened to stories of olden time, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
quaint words of counsel and comment as they
fell from the visitor’s lips. When the circle
finally dissolved, and Mr. Kellogg and his
entertainers were left alone, a psalm, which
seemed somehow to gain new meaning from
his reading of it, and a simple earnest prayer,
brought the long evening to a fitting and
memorable close.</p>

<p>It is interesting, moreover, to notice, as an
evidence of the profound regard and affection
which the Bowdoin students felt for Mr.
Kellogg, that when, in 1901, they published
a volume of Bowdoin tales, no other dedication
of the book was thought of than the one
which inscribes it to the memory of Elijah
Kellogg, “who celebrated his Alma Mater
in story, honored her by practical piety, and
won the hearts of her boys, his brethren.” If
he was not eminent in the prescribed studies
of the college, neither was he neglectful of
them, nor unfaithful to them. Perhaps his
enjoyment of college fellowships and his love
of fun interfered to some extent with his devotion
to the classics and mathematics, which
made up a large part of the curriculum, and,
in addition, the necessity under which he lay
of providing for his own expenses must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
diverted a part of his energies from study to
manual toil. But whether at work, at play,
or at study, he was hearty and resourceful.
An incident, as told by himself, illustrates
this trait of his character, and, incidentally,
introduces the president whose sombre dignity
provoked the stealing and subsequent disposal
of his hat, as already related.</p>

<p>“I had to work my way through college,”
said Mr. Kellogg, “and I boarded with a
woman named Susan Dunning. I came to
her house one Saturday. There was a deep
snow on the ground, and college was to open
Monday. She was feeling very blue because
her well-sweep had broken. I told her not to
mind, I’d fix it. The snow was too deep to
get the cattle out, so I took a sled, and going
to a wood-lot cut a big, heavy pole, it took
a big one, too, for an old well-sweep. I put it
on the sled, and tried to haul it back; but the
long end dragging in the deep snow made
that impossible. So, instead of hauling it, I
took hold of the end and started pushing it
home. It was hard work, but to make it
worse President Allen met me and remarked,
‘Well, Kellogg, I have heard of putting the
cart before the horse, but I never saw it done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
before;’ then he burst into a hearty laugh,
and that’s the only time I ever saw him even
smile in all the years I knew him.”</p>

<p>Besides President Allen, who was a man of
learning and piety, as well as soberness, and
whose single laugh, as chronicled by Mr.
Kellogg, may perhaps be extenuated on the
ground that it was indulged in before the
term began, it was a notable group of men
under whose influence and instruction Mr.
Kellogg came during his residence at Bowdoin.
There was Professor Alpheus S. Packard,
whose elegant culture and kindly heart
and beautiful face relieved the tedium of the
Greek class-room, and impressed themselves
upon the grateful memories of not less than
sixty classes of Bowdoin students. There
was Professor Thomas C. Upham, the quaint
and shy philosopher, who had in himself so
much of the mystic and seer combined with
the patient metaphysical analyst that it sent
him from time to time into bursts of religious
song, and assured his name an honored
place among the hymn-writers as well as
among the philosophers. There was Professor
Samuel P. Newman, who, by precept and
criticism, imparted as much as can be imparted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of the art of rhetoric, in which Mr. Kellogg
was to become so much of a proficient. There
was Professor William Smyth, rugged, impetuous,
and true, an apostle of abolition, an
enthusiastic champion of popular education
and, indeed, of every good cause, and, above
all, a profound and famous mathematician,
about whom Mr. Kellogg relates the somewhat
apocryphal story of the “Mathematician
in Shafts,” not, as may be seen, to suggest
ridicule, but in a sort of fond and amused
recognition of his unique and vigorous personality.
And finally, not to make the
catalogue too long, there was Professor Parker
Cleaveland, the distinguished scholar and
teacher of chemistry and mineralogy, and a
man of idiosyncrasies as striking as were his
gifts. In a beautiful memorial sonnet Longfellow
said of him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Among the many lives that I have known</div>
  <div class="verse">None I remember more serene and sweet,</div>
  <div class="verse">More rounded in itself, and more complete.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“From Seniors to Freshmen,” says Mr. Kellogg, “all believed in, loved, and were proud of
the reputation of the scholarly, kind-hearted,
democratic, and, at times, compassionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
professor.” And at the close of the chapter
which is devoted to illustrations of Professor
Cleaveland’s eccentric ways and beneficent
influence, Mr. Kellogg is moved to this earnest
and affectionate expression of his reverence: “Blessings on thy memory, faithful
one,&mdash;faithful even unto death,&mdash;to whom
was committed the gift to stir young hearts
to noble enterprise and manly effort; who
knew how to train the youthful eye to look
upon, and the heart to pant after, the goal
thou hadst reached! Those most amused
with thy peculiarities loved thee best. From
hence removed to the presence and enjoyment
of Him whose wisdom, power, and goodness,
manifested in the material world, thou to us
didst so worthily explain and illustrate, we
shall behold thy form and press thy hand no
more; but only with life shall we surrender
the memory of him who united the attributes
of both teacher and friend.”</p>

<p>It is impossible that under the personal influence
of these teachers, and of their instruction,
young Kellogg, with his frank and
susceptible nature, should not have been
stimulated to intellectual effort, and to moral
earnestness, and that he should not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
retained in subsequent life some impress from
their vigorous and scholarly and noble characters.
How much he owed them in the
direction and the development of his powers
we may not say. It is never possible to
measure, or to estimate exactly, the total
influence of a teacher’s life and work upon
his pupils. It acts often in ways that do
not disclose themselves to our perception; it
touches the young men at points and moments
of which we do not know the responsive or
the repelling significance; it often produces
effects which are the very opposite of what we
should predict; it falls into the ground and
dies, as it were, and years afterward springs
up and bears fruit in a form so changed that
we do not recognize the seed in the resulting
harvest; it is often hidden in the hearts of the
young men, and works by way of impulse or
restraint so subtly that they themselves are
not conscious of it; and so we can never tell
to what extent a young man’s character has
been formed or modified by the influence of
his teachers. But there is certainly some
indication of Mr. Kellogg’s own estimate
of what he owed to college instruction and
stimulus in the ardent and unwavering affec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>tion
which he always exhibited for his Alma
Mater, and which was abundantly reciprocated
in the reverent honor accorded to him by the
college, and by all its students and alumni.
At the one-hundredth anniversary of the college,
in 1894, there were more than a thousand
graduates assembled at the banquet in a
mammoth tent on the campus. Mr. Kellogg
had, with some difficulty, been persuaded to
be present. He was, of course, called upon
for a speech; and when he rose to respond,
every graduate, young and old, in the great
company was instantly on his feet, cheering
and shouting a glad salute. It was a touching
and memorable ovation, and the flush of
troubled happiness that flitted across his
bronzed and wrinkled face was something long
to be remembered, as was also his glowing
tribute of affection for the college, which was
his answer to the welcome of his brethren.</p>

<p>In Mr. Kellogg’s student days the chief
literary interest and activity of the undergraduates,
and no small part of their more
formal social life, centred about two societies,
the Peucinean and the Athenæan. Between
these two societies there was intense rivalry in
securing accessions from among the more de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>sirable
members of newly entering classes, in
public exhibitions and anniversary exercises,
and in the distribution of college and class
honors. Each society possessed a considerable
library of carefully selected books, and each
held regular weekly meetings for literary exercises
consisting of essays, poems, declamations,
and debates. Kellogg was an active
and esteemed member of the Peucinean society,
and contributed not a little to the
interest of its meetings in the several features
of their literary programmes. Mr. Henry H.
Boody, of the class of 1842, and subsequently
professor of rhetoric and oratory in the college
from 1845 to 1854, recalls the fact that at the
meetings of the Peucinean society, “we used to
consider a poem by Kellogg as a very rare
treat,” and then adds that perhaps “our liking
for the man influenced our judgment as to the
merit of his productions in that line.” However
that may be, it is evident that his gifts of
tongue and pen were freely exercised during
his undergraduate days, and that the charm
of them was felt and acknowledged by his
college associates.</p>

<p>In Mr. Kellogg’s Junior year a literary
magazine, the second venture of the kind at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Bowdoin, was projected by some of the students,
and made its first appearance, under
the name of the <i>Bowdoin Portfolio</i>, in April,
1839. Its advent was heralded, in a manner
somewhat figurative and characteristic of the
time, by an editorial note, of which the following
are some of the first sentences:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A short time since, as we were sitting
quietly in our room discussing the common
topics of the day, we were suddenly surprised
and pleased by the entrance of a comely
youth, of an ideal nature, that is, made up of
the immaterial mind, but who had embodied
himself in a visible form. He was arrayed in
a neat, simple garb, evidently preferring pure
simplicity to ostentatious splendor, and wishing
to attract notice, not so much by a showy
dress and gorgeous outward appearance, as by
the spiritual within, made clear and comprehensible
by the outward representation. On
his front he bore the name of ’Bowdoin Portfolio,’
and in communing with him we found
a most entertaining and agreeable companion.
He was just making his debut into the literary
world, and it was with modesty and timidity
that he declared to us his intentions of speedily
making his bow, and paying court to the
public.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no indication that Mr. Kellogg
was connected with the editorial board of the
<i>Portfolio</i>, but there are contributions from
him in three of the seven numbers that were
published, and all his contributions are of
verse. This fact recalls the testimony that
has been quoted as to the pleasure with which
his poems were received at the meetings of
the Peucinean society. Altogether it seems
as if, during his college days, his tastes led
him to the cultivation of poetry, and as if
the impression he made upon his college
mates was rather by his verse than by his
prose.</p>

<p>One of the poems in the <i>Portfolio</i> is a
clever translation of a Latin epitaph upon a
moth miller which “came bustling through
the window directly into the editorial taper,
and fell lifeless upon the sheet of paper.” A
part of the epitaph in Kellogg’s verse is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Whose greatest crime was to intrude</div>
  <div class="verse">Upon a Poet’s solitude;</div>
  <div class="verse">Whose saddest fortune was to fly</div>
  <div class="verse">In a Poet’s lamp, and cheated die.</div>
  <div class="verse">Ah! punishment to rashness due,</div>
  <div class="verse">How certain! and how direful too!</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
  <div class="verse">The silly Moth thus seeking light</div>
  <div class="verse">Is overwhelmed in shades of night;</div>
  <div class="verse">So Youth pursuing Pleasure’s ray</div>
  <div class="verse">O’ertakes grim Death upon the way!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Latin of the epitaph is of that obvious
kind which an American college boy is likely
to write, and there is really more distinction
in Kellogg’s translation than in the original.</p>

<p>The other poems contributed by Kellogg to
the <i>Portfolio</i> are entitled, “The Phantoms of
the Mind,” and “The Demon of the Sea.”
They are both vigorous in sentiment and correct
in form, and the opening lines of the
latter remind us of the author’s early, and,
indeed, lifelong passion for the sea:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Ah, tell me not of your shady dells</div>
  <div class="verse">Where the lilies gleam, and the fountain wells,</div>
  <div class="verse">Where the reaper rests when his task is o’er,</div>
  <div class="verse">And the lake-wave sobs on the verdant shore,</div>
  <div class="verse">And the rustic maid, with a heart all free,</div>
  <div class="verse">Hies to the well-known trysting-tree;</div>
  <div class="verse">For I’m the God of the rolling sea,</div>
  <div class="verse">And the charms of earth are nought to me.</div>
  <div class="verse">O’er the thundering chime of the breaking surge,</div>
  <div class="verse">On the lightning’s wing my pathway urge,</div>
  <div class="verse">On thrones of foam right joyous ride,</div>
  <div class="verse">’Mid the sullen dash of the angry tide.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<p>It is not altogether fancy that recognizes in
such lines as these hints of the impetuous and
stirring rhetoric of Mr. Kellogg’s later prose,
especially on occasions when his deepest feelings
were moved, and he spoke of love and
duty, of character and destiny, of life and
immortality, out of the fulness of his conviction,
and with the ardor and eloquence of his
sensitive and poetic nature.</p>

<p>So passed his college days, in the keen enjoyment
of generous comradeship, in the instinctive
indulgence of his fondness for fun
and frolic, in the cheerful acceptance of the
burden of defraying his own expenses, in
manly fidelity to the appointed studies of the
course, and in the voluntary and congenial
exercise of the literary gifts with which he
was endowed, and through which he has made
so many of us his debtors. And through it
all he preserved the unaffected simplicity and
purity of heart, the reverence for truth, and
the consideration and charity for his fellows,
which were the winning characteristics of his
whole life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Kellogg’s theological training in immediate
preparation for the ministry was received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
at Andover Theological Seminary from 1840
to 1843. The intellectual and social conditions
which prevail at the professional school
are quite unlike those of the college. It does
not have the same atmosphere of venerated
tradition and compelling custom, nor is it the
scene of a life so varied and buoyant. The
students are older, more sedate, and more intent
upon the special studies of the place.
They have passed through the period of boyish
effervescence and frolic, of ardent and generous
comradeship, of steadfast friendships and
changing schemes of life, of relative unconcern
for what lies beyond the horizon of the
college world&mdash;and the period is not to be
repeated. They are committed to common
pursuits and ambitions, and are sobered by
the duties and responsibilities of life to which
they are sensibly drawing near.</p>

<p>In his college life Mr. Kellogg found the
material for a series of sparkling stories, evidently
as congenial to himself as they have
been interesting to his readers; but of life in
the seminary he has given us no picture.
This is not to the discredit of the honored
school of theology to which he went, nor does
it imply that he did not enter into its studies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and its life with heartiness and joy, but it is
a natural result of the distinction which has
been suggested between the college and the
professional school. The picturesque nook or
landscape attracts the pencil or the brush of
the artist, but his choice does not discredit the
thousand scenes of field and pasture and hill
and woodland which he passes by as unsuited
to his artistic purpose.</p>

<p>It is enough to mention the names of
Moses Stuart, Bela Edwards, Leonard Woods,
Ralph Emerson, and Edwards Park, to show
that Mr. Kellogg was as fortunate in his
teachers at the seminary as he had been at
the college. They were men of profound
learning, of stimulating influence, of consecrated
character, and of great and deserved
reputation. They could not fail to quicken
and enrich both his intellectual and his spiritual
nature, and to send him forth fully
instructed, as well as profoundly eager, to
preach with persuasiveness and power, as he
did preach for nearly half a century.</p>

<p>It was while he was a student in the seminary
that Mr. Kellogg wrote the famous
declamation, “Spartacus to the Gladiators,”
as well as some others, almost equally famous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
of the same general character. It was written
for one of the prescribed rhetorical exercises
of the course, at which the writer or speaker
was publicly criticised by members of the
student body, and also by the professor in
charge. Mr. Kellogg, always timid at the
prospect of open and formal criticism of his
writing or speech, greatly dreaded the ordeal,
and resolved to write something which should
so interest his hearers by its unusual subject-matter
as to divert their minds from the
thought of criticism. His scheme was completely
successful. The students listened with
breathless attention, and were dumb when
the speech was concluded. To the inquiry of
Professor Park if there were any criticisms
to be offered, not a voice was raised; and the
professor himself remarked that though
there were some things, perhaps, that might
be said in criticism, yet it was so admirable a
specimen of masterful rhetoric that he should
say nothing. It has been considered so much
of a masterpiece in its kind, that at Andover
they still point out No. 20 Bartlett Hall as
the room in which it was written.</p>

<p>There is an unmistakable dramatic quality
in the conception and speech of “Spartacus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>”
as there were hints of such a dramatic quality
in some of Mr. Kellogg’s sermons in later
years, and it is interesting to note that, in his
Senior year at Andover, he wrote a “dialogue,”
or brief play, called “The Honest
Deserter,” which was performed by the Philomathean
Society of Phillips Academy. The
occasion of its presentation was considered of
so much interest and importance that an elm
tree was planted in the Phillips yard in commemoration
of the event.</p>

<p>When in his Senior year as a theological
student Mr. Kellogg went to Harpswell to
preach for some weeks, his personality and
his preaching, his love of the sea and his
kindly human qualities, so won the hearts of
the Harpswell people that they besought him
to return to Harpswell after his graduation,
and become their pastor. To their urgent
request he yielded, being himself much attracted
by the people and their home by the
sea. It was in 1844 that he was publicly
installed over the church, and the official tie
of pastor to the Harpswell church was severed
only by his death.</p>

<h2><a name="EARLY_HARPSWELL_DAYS" id="EARLY_HARPSWELL_DAYS"></a>EARLY HARPSWELL DAYS</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wilmot Brookings Mitchell</span></p>


<p>Harpswell, Maine, is a seaboard, almost a
sea-girt, town. It is made up of a long, narrow
neck of land and forty islands, some
containing hundreds of acres, others almost
entirely covered by the tide. Indenting the
shore of this peninsula and the larger islands
are sheltered inlets of deep water well suited
to the building and harboring of ships. Hither
came, during the first half of the eighteenth
century, from Boston, Scituate, York, and
other settlements, men and women of Puritan
stock and Puritan ways of thinking;
and here grew up large families, hardy and
God-fearing, some farmers, but most of them
fishermen, sailors, and ship-builders.</p>

<p>Elijah Kellogg could not long attend
Bowdoin College, only a few miles distant,
without being attracted to these sea-going
people of Harpswell; for Kellogg was born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
with webbed feet. When hardly out of the
cradle, family tradition has it, he went to sail
in Back Cove, Portland, with a sugar-box for
a boat and his shirt for a sail. As a youngster
he would often steal to the Fore Street
wharves to watch the ships, and he was never
so happy as when listening to the yarns
which the sailors spun. He says of himself, “At ten years of age I began to climb the
rigging, and at fifteen went to sea.” His
years in the “fo’c’sle,” with all their perilous
and disagreeable tasks, only intensified his
love for the water. As a Freshman he took
supreme delight in sailing with a good comrade,
on a Saturday afternoon, in his little
cat-rigged boat, the <i>Cadet</i>, among the islands
of Casco Bay.</p>

<p>One of these half-holiday expeditions affected,
as it happened, his whole after-life.
The <i>Cadet</i>, belated by wind and tide, ran
ashore on Birch Island, and “Captain” Kellogg
and crew, supperless and weary, sought
shelter at the house of Captain John Skolfield.
Mr. Kellogg never forgot how cosily
the light from the house that evening
shone through the hop vines growing over
and around the windows. The hospitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
islander gave the wayfarers a warm welcome
and a plentiful supper; for which hospitality,
before the evening ended, Kellogg, full of
stories of college and the sea, made his host
feel well repaid. Thus began his acquaintance
with the Birch Islanders,&mdash;the Skolfields,
Curtises, and Merrimans,&mdash;an acquaintance
which was to ripen into a life-long friendship.
The men on this island, hardy, powerful, and
fearless, at once became heroes in the admiring
eyes of this venture-loving student. After
this he spent many happy hours building
boats, gunning and fishing with Captain John,
or spinning yarns and reading aloud with “Uncle Joe” Curtis,&mdash;a man who read every
book he could get hold of and who remembered
everything he read.</p>

<p>From Birch Island to Harpswell Neck,
where Eaton’s store and the church were
located, is but a short row; there Kellogg
often went to buy something for his boat, or
to worship on the Sabbath. Before long he
had many friends and admirers upon the
mainland; for these people had but to see the
sharp-eyed, brown, wiry “colleger,” and hear
his stories, or listen to his earnest and eloquent
exhortations in the prayer-meeting, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
order to love him. It was with them, as
well as with him, love at first sight; and
by the time he was a Sophomore they had
plighted troth. Learning that he was to
study for the ministry, they must have him
for their preacher; and he, half jokingly
perhaps, told them if he lived to get through
the seminary and they built a new church,
he would come to preach for them.</p>

<p>After graduation at Bowdoin, Kellogg began
the study of theology at Andover. When
his course at the seminary was near its close,
Professor Thomas C. Upham, who had been
so stanch a friend of the Harpswell church
that Mr. Kellogg once said it owed its very
existence to him, came to Andover with a
message from the Harpswell people that the
timber for the new church was on the spot,
and they still wanted him for a preacher.
The bearer of the message evidently saw in
the young preacher the salvation of the
Harpswell church; for he reënforced this reminder
of the promise Kellogg had made in
his student days by the emphatic prophecy
that God would curse him as long as he lived
if he did not go. Influenced somewhat by
these prophetic words, but probably much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
more by his love for the place and the people
and the opportunity he saw of doing good, he
turned away from a call to a much larger
church and went to Harpswell, where, as he
said many years later, he found that “obedience
is sweet and not servitude.”</p>

<p>Although Mr. Kellogg, in response to this informal
invitation, began at once to supply the
pulpit in the old church, a formal call to settle
as pastor was not extended to him until the
next year. The reason for this becomes apparent
upon an examination of the church
records.</p>

<p>The original Harpswell church and parish
were at this time passing through a transition
period. Formed in 1751, the parish was at
first identical with the town. The preacher’s
salary and other church expenses were assessed
by the town officers as taxes. But
later, other churches having been built and
other denominations having sprung up, many
citizens objected to being taxed for the support
of the minister, and some absolutely refused
to pay such taxes. A troublesome question
concerning the control and ownership of the
first church building also arose between the
town and the parish. Accordingly the sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>porters
of the Congregational church organized
a new society and erected a new church
building.</p>

<p>This church was dedicated September 28,
1843. For this dedication the following poem
was written by Mr. Kellogg:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Here, ’mid the strife of wind and waves</div>
  <div class="verse">Upon a wild and stormy sod,</div>
  <div class="verse">Beside our fathers’ homes and graves,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>The records show that on April 25, 1844,
with Professor Upham as moderator, it was “moved and voted that the church of the
Centre Congregational Society in Harpswell
do hereby invite and call Mr. Elijah Kellogg
to settle with them as their pastor in the
Gospel ministry and [do agree] to pay [him]
by subscription $300 a year for four years
from the first day of June, 1844.” This
call to what proved to be a long and fruitful
pastorate Mr. Kellogg, on May 4, 1844,
accepted in these simple and earnest words: “Brethren and Beloved: I have considered
your call to settle with you as a minister of
the New Testament. It appears to me to be
the will of God pointed out by his providence
that I comply with your invitation, which I
accordingly do, praying that it may be a connection
full of blessed fruits both to pastor
and people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>The new pastor was ordained on June 18,
1844. He entered with enthusiasm into his
work. Among these rugged farmers, fishermen,
and sailors, he sought in all ways to
expound and exemplify the teachings of Him
who many years before taught the fishermen
of Galilee. On the Sabbath he preached sermons
so interesting and eloquent that people
came in boat loads from the islands to hear his
words; and he entered familiarly and sympathetically
into the home life of his parishioners. “His little boat might be seen in all
weathers flitting to and fro between mainland
and islands as he made the circuit of his watery
parish in visits of friendship or of consolation,
to officiate at a marriage or a funeral. He
was heartily welcome in every home, for he
knew their domestic life, and seemed to be a
part of it; and he talked of the sea and of
Him who made it in a way that brought him
close to the hearts of his people, and made
religion seem a natural and practical and important
part of daily life. He rebuked wrong-doing,
recognized and applauded every good
act or effort, composed differences between
neighbors, helped in manual toil, comforted
the afflicted, gave to the poor,&mdash;and all in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
such a simple, unconventional, and genuine
fashion, that his people felt that he was one
of them, only better than the rest.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> From an address by Professor Henry L. Chapman,
delivered at the Maine State Congregational Conference,
September, 1901.</p></div>

<p>The pastor of the early forties was often
formal, arbitrary, and autocratic, seeking to
drive rather than to lead his flock. Between
pastor and people there was too often a great
gulf fixed. But this humorous, unpretentious,
sincere man did not hold himself as of finer
clay than his people. He liked to plant and
reap with his parishioners. To pull rockweed
and pitch hay and chop wood, to swing the
flail and hold the plough, were not beneath his
dignity.</p>

<p>One Sunday during these first years of his
pastorate, just after reading the usual notices,
he said: “Widow Jones’s grass, I see, needs
mowing. I shall be in her field to-morrow
morning at half-past four with scythe, rake,
and pitch-fork. I shall be glad to see all of
you there who wish to come and help me.”
The next morning found a good crew of men
and boys in the field ready for work. Among
them was a man six feet two in his stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>ing-feet
and weighing some 250 pounds.
Captain Griggs we will call him. As they
were working up the field near each other,
the captain said, “Parson, I am going to
cut your corners this morning.” The little
wiry parson, who had served a good apprenticeship
upon his uncle’s farm in Gorham, whet
his scythe and kept his counsel. The big captain
didn’t cut any of his corners that day.
Indeed, the story goes that before noon the
man who thought that he could mow around
the parson, dropped under a tree, exhausted
by the terrific pace that Kellogg set.</p>

<p>Before he had completed the first year of
his ministry, Mr. Kellogg was elected a member
of the school committee, on which he
served several years. That he sought to do
his duty on the school board faithfully is
attested by the resolution&mdash;heroic it will seem
to some&mdash;which he recorded on December 8,
1844. “Having never till this time been fully
convinced of the importance of mathematics
in strengthening the mind and preparing it to
investigate truth, and never having been able
to conquer my dislike for them till led to them
by the study of philosophy and an impression
of the interdependence of all philosophy and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
science, I now begin at the bottom and determine
to push my researches as far as possible
and to set down whatever may be worthy
of note. I this day commenced Emerson’s
Arithmetic in order to be prepared to do my
duty thoroughly as one of the superintending
committee.” As committeeman, he did more
than make a perfunctory visit twice a term.
He kept his eyes open for the alert, promising,
studious lad. Such a boy he encouraged,
advised concerning his studies, and often
urged to go to Master Swallow’s school in
Brunswick and fit for college. These boys
he picked carefully, for he didn’t believe in “wasting nails by driving them into rotten
wood.”</p>

<p>From the first of his ministry to the very
end, Mr. Kellogg showed an instinctive knowledge
of boys, and originality in dealing with
them. Any just estimate of his work and
character must rate high his tact in handling
and influencing boys. Wherever he
preached, boys were quick to see that he
was their friend, a man after their own
heart. They soon found that this unconventional,
simple, eloquent little man, who
had a way of throwing his arm over a boy’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
shoulder and walking home from the evening
meeting with him, was more than an ordinary
preacher. They found that he could understand
them. They could tell him their jokes
and their serious plans, and he could see
through their eyes and hear through their
ears. They found that he, more perhaps
than any other man they had ever known,
was all the time at heart a boy himself;
that he was interested in them not simply
as a professional duty, but because he
couldn’t help it. He loved boys, was happy
in their companionship, and delighted to
talk of his own boyhood and college days,&mdash;of
the time when the frogs by croaking “K’logg, K’logg,” called him away from
school, or when he in recitation informed
his dignified professor that Polycarp was one
of the <i>many</i> daughters of Mr. Carp. He
would swim and sail and farm and fish with
the boys in his parish, and then, at an unexpected
moment, but in a manner not repellent,
he would kneel down in their boat or
in the field by the side of a cock of hay or
a shock of corn and pray with them.</p>

<p>Many men to-day who were born and bred
in Harpswell like to tell of the way he won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
and kept their friendship. Here, for example,
was a boy whom he was taking to Portland
in his boat; the youngster felt very proud,
for his grandmother had intrusted to him
her eggs to take to market. But alas! in
disembarking he dropped the basket, and the
eggs were smashed. The boy’s extremity,
however, was the preacher’s opportunity. By
paying for those eggs from his own pocketbook,
he saved the young marketman no end
of humiliation, and bound him to his soul
with a hoop of steel.</p>

<p>If one may judge by his journal and correspondence,
no work that Mr. Kellogg did
during his long life afforded him greater satisfaction
or yielded larger returns in affection
and gratitude and right living than his work
with boys. When, for instance, he had
been on Harpswell Neck less than a year,
he heard that a schooner had put into
Potts’s Point, some ten miles below his home,
with a boy on board who had broken his leg.
He knew that this boy on a small schooner
in a strange place would need sadly the comforts
of home. He hastened to him, brought
him to his boarding-place, put him in his own
bed, and nursed him as he would have nursed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
a son. When the boy was able to go to sea
again, having no money, he could repay his
benefactor for all the trouble and expense he
had been, only with words of kindness and
gratitude. Years afterwards, however, when
Mr. Kellogg was preaching in Boston, a well-dressed
man and woman came into the sailors’
church, and appeared much interested in the
sermon. At the close of the service they
came forward and spoke to the preacher.
The boy had now become a man&mdash;the mate
of a large ship. The bread which the young
minister had cast upon the waters now returned
to him after twenty years, in the
words of affection and encouragement with
which this man and his wife expressed
their gratitude, also in the $50 which, as
they bade him good-by, they left in his
hand.</p>

<p>For some years Bowdoin College, recognizing
Mr. Kellogg’s power in getting at the
heart of boys, had the custom of sending to
him some of the students whom it rusticated;
and his strong, manly character
brought more than one boy to his better
self. That his treatment of these boys was
not exactly that of Squeers, this instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
will show. One young fellow whom the
college sent him was especially rebellious
at first. Through cheap story papers he had
come cheek by jowl with old Sleuth and
his boon companions, and he sought to emulate
them by carrying a revolver and a dirk
knife. Mr. Kellogg told him that as he would
not find any Indians or many wild beasts
down there, he had better surrender his
weapons. This the young man did after
much reluctance. During the first day, Mr.
Kellogg left him to himself, as he was
inclined to sulk. In the evening he began
to talk to the boy indifferently at first, afterwards
kindly. All the time&mdash;lover-like&mdash;he
kept edging up nearer to him on the big
sofa, and finally in his genuine, whole-souled
way, put his hand affectionately on the lad’s
shoulder. To such treatment the young fellow
was not accustomed. It was so different
from his over-stern father’s that it threw him
entirely off his guard. He could not withstand
the man’s kindly interest and genuine
manner. His rebellious spirit was broken.
The boy dreaded his father’s rebuke, and
the next day, unknown to him, Mr. Kellogg
wrote to his mother, telling all about her son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and urging that the father write to him kindly
and not sternly. A few days after this the
young fellow was surprised and delighted to
receive from home a letter of forgiveness and
encouragement.</p>

<p>On July 4, there was to be a celebration
in Portland. The boy wished but did not
expect to go. “Well,” said Mr. Kellogg one
day after they had been speaking of the matter, “I am afraid you can’t go. I have no
authority to let you. But, then, I really want
to attend that celebration myself, and I can’t
be expected to leave you at home alone.”
When the day of celebration came, the student
and the preacher could have been seen tramping
the streets of Portland, both, no doubt,
having a right royal good time.</p>

<p>A few years ago, the heart of the aged
minister was uplifted by the assurance that he
had dealt aright with this high-spirited lad.
A successful business man, the vice-president
of a large western railroad, came many miles
to look again into his kindly face and to tell
him that those weeks of companionship full
of honest counsel marked the turning-point in
his life.</p>

<p>For the first five years of his life in Harps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>well,
Mr. Kellogg boarded at the home of one
of his parishioners, Mr. Joseph Eaton. Here
his mother spent the summers with him, his
father having died in 1843. In 1849 he
bought a farm of thirty-five acres at North
Harpswell, and at once began to build a house
that he might provide a suitable home for his
lame and aged mother. The location of this
house is an attractive one. It is on the western
side of Harpswell Neck, a half-mile or so
from the main-travelled road. From it the
land slopes gently an eighth of a mile, perhaps,
to the shore of Middle Bay. From the windows
of the house which he here built, one
peeping through the oaks and spruces on a
summer’s day may see to the west, across
the sparkling water of the channel, the green
sloping bank of Simpson’s Point, or to the
south Birch and Scrag islands and several
of the other 363 which dot the waters of
Casco Bay. The house itself is a wooden,
two-story, L-shaped farm-house facing the
west, bespeaking nothing of luxury, but
large enough to be airy in the summer,
and in the winter a good place, as Captain
Rhines would say, in which to ride out the
storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Much of the material of which the house
is made Mr. Kellogg brought here from
different parts of his parish; some strong
timbers from Ragged Island, three miles out
at sea, fine sand for his mortar from Sand
Island, and the door-stone from Birch. Nearly
all of the larger timbers in his house this
preacher cut and hauled himself. And when
they were on the spot, seventy-five of his
friends and neighbors, giving him a good
surprise, as did those of Lion Ben in the Elm
Island stories, came and hewed the timbers
and framed his house. Little wonder is it
that this house, with its attractive surroundings
and its pleasant associations, was ever to
him the most beautiful place on earth.</p>

<p>He lived here with his mother and housekeeper
until 1852, when his mother died.
This bereavement took a strong influence out
of his life; for the tactful, firm-willed mother
had played a large part in moulding the character
of her impetuous, venturesome son. In
1854 he married Miss Hannah Pearson Pomeroy,
daughter of Rev. Thaddeus Pomeroy of
Syracuse, New York, previously pastor of the
Congregational church of Gorham, Maine.
Three children were born to them: a son who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
died in infancy; Frank Gilman, at present in
business in Boston; and Mary Catherine, the
wife of Mr. Harry Batchelder of Melrose
Highlands, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The circumstances of Mr. Kellogg’s marriage
are characteristic. While he always
maintained a due respect for women, he was
preeminently a man’s man or perhaps better
a boy’s man. It is not surprising, then, to be
told that his wife was “recommended to him.”
A friend of his at Gorham, rallying him a bit
on his bachelorhood, asked why in the world
he did not marry. “Oh,” said he, “I can
find no one to have me.” Whereupon his
friend replied, “There is your old schoolmate,
Hannah Pomeroy of Syracuse, a minister’s
daughter, well educated, a good school-teacher,
and smart as a whip; just the woman for a
minister’s wife.” What had been the preacher’s
previous plans concerning matrimony is not
known, but before long he took a trip to Syracuse,
and when he returned, the bargain was
practically made. Though apparently so businesslike
a transaction, this proved to be for
more than forty years a happy union. His
friend spoke truly. Had Mr. Kellogg searched
many years, he could not have found a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
helpmate than Hannah Pomeroy. Attractive,
sincere, energetic, practical, she was a prudent,
encouraging wife and a wise, loving mother.</p>

<p>The folk-lore of Harpswell contains many
stories of this minister’s daring on sea and
land and of his original ways in dealing with
both saints and sinners; so original, indeed,
that one rough old admirer on Ragged Island,
whom Mr. Kellogg had influenced for good in
a way that no other minister had ever thought
of doing, said that when Parson Kellogg died,
he was going to carve upon his tombstone
three letters&mdash;”D. F. M.” The last two were
to stand for “Funny Minister.”</p>

<p>This daring parson had upon his farm a
bull that rendered himself extremely obnoxious
to visitors who found it convenient
to reach his house by crossing the pasture.
The bull, therefore, must be disciplined. The
preacher first harnessed Mr. Taurus to the
front wheels of a heavy cart, preparatory to
putting him over the road and showing him
who was master. But before the guiding ropes
had been adequately arranged, the bull on a
mad rush took to the woods, leaving in his
trail fragments of cart-wheels and harness.
The little minister, however, was not thus to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
be outdone. The next day, at flood-tide, with
tempting fodder he allured the bull to the end
of the wharf and in an unguarded moment
shoved him into the bay. An excellent swimmer,
he then quickly jumped astride the bull’s
back. By grasping his horns and intermittently
thrusting his head under water, with a
prowess which a “broncho-buster” might well
envy, he conquered his steed. Thus, as all
stories rightly end, they lived happily together
ever afterwards.</p>

<p>Of this pastor’s unconventional methods in
accepting and dispensing gifts of charity, the
following are illustrative. One afternoon, just
before tea, he happened into the house of a
master ship-builder in his parish, a man of
property and influence. The old gentleman
was on the best of terms with the young
preacher, and after passing the time of day,
began to banter him on the condition of his
boots, which were muddy and somewhat the
worse for wear. “Parson, what makes you
wear such disreputable-looking foot-gear?” he
said. “Throw those boots away and let me
get you a new pair.” The parson waited till
later before he fired the return shot. After
all were comfortably seated at the tea-table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
and he had said grace, he asked to be excused
for a moment and went to the sitting room.
There a good fire was blazing upon the hearth,
and near by were the master-builder’s best
shoes. Quickly came off the parson’s old
boots, and into the fire they went; and as
quickly went on to stay the master-builder’s
best calfskins.</p>

<p>One winter day while on Orr’s Island, he
got an inkling that a family there was in distress.
By skilful inquiry he learned that the
father had been drinking badly, and the mother
and children needed food and fuel. Something
must be done at once to relieve them. Going
to the house of a well-to-do parishioner, he
requested the use of his horse and sled for
an hour or two. When they were ready, he
quickly drove up to the man’s woodpile and
loaded the sled generously, while the owner
stood by in wonderment. The only explanation
given was: “That family down there
need fuel badly. You’ve got a plenty, and
I’m going to haul them down a good load.”
And that was explanation enough, for Parson
Kellogg offered it.</p>

<p>Although so familiar and informal in his
social and pastoral relations, as a preacher he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
never hesitated to point out to his people
their duty in language that was unmistakable.
Soon after the new church was
built, for example, he told them that increased
privilege means ever increased responsibility. “God has given you,” he said, “a
commodious and elegant place of worship.
Why? That you might sit down and admire
it and be proud of it? Do that, and He will
wither you to the root. Do it, and He will
send leanness into your souls. My dear friends,
we had better, like our Puritan forefathers on
the coast of Holland, kneel down among the
rocks and seaweed in the cold winter to pray
to God with the humble spirit with which
they prayed than to worship Him here in
peace and comfort, surrounded with tasteful
decorations, without that humility. You have
heard of congratulation and praise as much as
you ought to hear. I wish you to look at
your increased responsibility. As God has
made you first in point of privilege, be not
by abusing those privileges the last to attain
salvation.”</p>

<p>In his pulpit, with plain-spoken words such
as these, and with quaint phrases, and apt
illustrations drawn from the farm, the forest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and the sea, this preacher quickened the conscience,
and broadened the sympathies, and
strengthened the faith of the farmers, fishermen,
and sailors, who heard him gladly. As
a preacher, “he seemed,” says one who knew
him well, “a prophet in the authority with
which he spoke, an evangelist in the tenderness
with which he appealed to the conscience
and set forth the promises of the Gospel, a
poet often in the simple beauty and grace
with which he portrayed the conditions of
human life, and discoursed of the deep things
of God.”</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SEAMANS_FRIEND" id="THE_SEAMANS_FRIEND"></a>THE SEAMAN’S FRIEND</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">George Kimball</span></p>


<p>At its annual meeting, May 17, 1854, the
Boston Seaman’s Friend Society accepted the
resignation of Rev. George W. Bourne, pastor
of the Mariners’ Church and chaplain of the
Sailors’ Home. The board of managers then
began the search for “a suitable man” for
the vacant position, and their choice fell upon
Rev. Elijah Kellogg of Harpswell, Maine.</p>

<p>Mr. Kellogg began his duties in September
of that year, with his accustomed earnestness,
and under his ministry the attendance
at the church increased, and a new impulse
was given to the society’s work.</p>

<p>He first appeared before the society at its
twenty-seventh anniversary, held in Tremont
Temple, May 30, 1855. A large audience was
assembled. President Alpheus Hardy introduced
him in complimentary terms, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
made an eloquent address. His “suitability”
as the seaman’s friend and pastor is shown in
these extracts: “The greater portion of my life
has been spent among seamen, either at sea or
on shore. The first personal effort, to any extent,
I made for the salvation of souls was while
teaching among a community of sailors. The
first sermon I preached was to sailors. The
first couple I united in marriage were a sailor
and his bride. The first child I baptized was
a sailor’s child. The first burial service I performed
was over the body of a seaman. The
society with which I have been connected during
the last eleven years is with scarcely an
exception composed of sailors and their families.
There is not a house in the parish in
which the roar of the surf may not be heard,
and in many of them the Atlantic flings its
spray upon the door-stone.... The men who
interest seamen and do them good have not
any recipe for it; neither can they impart it to
others. It is all instinctive. They love the
webbed feet, and the webbed feet love them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kellogg was at this time forty-one years
old. His pleasing personal appearance and his
hearty, rugged, forceful utterance made a
favorable impression upon his hearers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>The task he had undertaken was by no
means an easy one. It involved hard and
constant work, often of a kind little, if at all,
like that of the average clergyman. On the
Sabbath there were in the Mariners’ Church
three services for public worship, and the
Sunday-school. In addition to this work upon
the Sabbath, Mr. Kellogg conducted a social
religious meeting in the reading room of the
Sailors’ Home upon one evening of each week,
and in the winter lectured occasionally in the
church upon topics of vital interest. He visited
sailors upon shipboard and in hospital, offered
the comforts of religion to the sick and
dying, and often communicated to loved ones
the parting message they would never otherwise
have received. For this work the salary
was necessarily small, and the material equipment
not of the best; but Mr. Kellogg did
not hesitate. He threw himself into the work
with zeal and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>From the establishment of the Seaman’s
Friend Society in 1827 to July 12, 1852, religious
services were held at the Sailors’
Home, but upon the latter date the building
was burned. The church at the corner of
Summer and Sea streets, which had formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
been owned and used by the Christian Baptists,
was soon after purchased, and on December
30, 1852, was dedicated to the work for
sailors. A church building, in these days, like
the modest bethel in Summer Street would
be regarded as quaint in appearance and ill-adapted
to its uses. It was inferior, in many
ways, even to other churches of its day, but it
was easily accessible to those to whom it especially
ministered (wharves to the south were
then much more fully utilized by shipping than
they now are), and was in the centre of a favorite
residential district; for Fort Hill and surrounding
streets were at that time mainly
occupied by pretentious dwellings.</p>

<p>The Sailors’ Home, when rebuilt, was a
large brick structure upon the eastern slope of
Fort Hill, at 99 Purchase Street. Here, with
Mr. John O. Chaney as its superintendent,
many of the brave carriers of the commerce of
the world were comfortably housed and cared
for. The Home had a large reading room
and library, and besides providing good board
and home comforts, it did much from time to
time for the relief of shipwrecked and destitute
sailors. Often hundreds of sailors were
here. The very year Mr. Kellogg began his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
work it sheltered 2458, and during his chaplaincy
of nearly eleven years 25,358 were
beneath its roof.</p>

<p>In urging the need and importance of such
an institution as a haven of rest, a “port in
a storm,” Mr. Kellogg once said: “Suppose
twenty-five seamen from Calcutta, with beard
and hair of 130 days’ growth, hammocks,
canvas bags, sheath knives, chests lashed up
with tarred rigging, redolent of bilge water,
with a monkey or two, and three or four
parrots, should drive up to the Revere
House in a North End wagon, and say, ’We
want to stop here; our money is as good as
anybody’s,’ would they stop there? Would
their money be as good as anybody’s? I trow
not. Let them, repulsed from the Revere,
go to the Marlboro,&mdash;a temperance, pious
house, prayers night and morning,&mdash;and tell
the proprietor if he does not take them in they
must go to a place that leads to a drunkard’s
grave and the drunkard’s hell, would they be
taken in there, think you? This shows the
need of a Sailors’ Home, does it not?”</p>

<p>When Mr. Kellogg had been at work
awhile, Captain Andrew Bartlett of Plymouth,
a retired ship-master, was employed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
society as a missionary helper. Always faithful
and zealous, as “a lieutenant to Mr.
Kellogg,”&mdash;so he styled himself,&mdash;Captain
Bartlett proved of valuable assistance. With
his aid libraries were placed upon shipboard
to be managed by Christian sailors, and
the minor details of the work went forward
successfully.</p>

<p>Another fruitful source of increased life and
enthusiasm in the work came early in Mr.
Kellogg’s pastorate. It was a body of young
men drawn by the personal magnetism of the
popular preacher, inspired by his earnestness
and devotion, and moved by their own desire
to be of service in the good cause. He issued
no special call, made no urgent appeal, for
these helpers. One by one they came, impelled
by the promptings of the Holy Spirit.
They rallied like a forlorn hope in a desperate
encounter, each feeling that his services were
needed. They were ready for any service
their Divine Guide and their beloved leader
might require of them, should it carry them
even to “moving accidents by flood and field.”
They had heard the “still, small voice,” and
had responded, “Here am I; send me.”</p>

<p>Captain Bartlett early reported: “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
young men of the church are Mr. Kellogg’s
body-guard. They are a sort of flying artillery.
They visit the receiving-ship, the
Marine Hospital, and other places. They hold
meetings, and talk with sailors.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kellogg in an annual address before
the society said: “An army of young men are
putting their strength to the wheel of a difficult
and hitherto well-nigh discouraging work.
It was feared by many, when these efforts
began, that they were the outgrowth of romance
and the love of novelty, and would be
of transient duration; but they have assumed
the same enduring character as the other departments
of labor. At the hospital, on board
the receiving-ship, at the Mariners’ Church
on Sabbath evenings, they have entered heart
and hand into this work, and, from their very
youth, adapted to the impulsive nature of seamen,
they have been in the hands of God a
most efficient instrumentality for good.”</p>

<p>This army of young men grew very rapidly
during the revival of 1858, and by the beginning
of the Civil War was of creditable size.
At the Sunday evening prayer-meetings it
made itself especially felt. On these occasions
the church was always crowded. Minis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>ters
of the Gospel, merchants, young people,
and captains of ships sat side by side with
men whom every wind had blown upon, from
the equator to the pole, all uniting in fervent
prayer to the same great Father, all striving
to bring each other to a knowledge of the
truth. Not an evangelical denomination in
the city was unrepresented, and it is impossible
to form even an approximate estimate of
the amount of good accomplished, for these
meetings were exceptional both in number of
attendants and in interest shown.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="p080"></a>
<img src="images/p080.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Elijah Kellogg at Forty-three.</span><br />1856.</div>
</div>

<p>But war came, and it found the Mariners’
Church patriotic to the very core. Mr. Kellogg
had to report that sixty-eight of his“body-guard” had enlisted to fight for the
preservation of the Union, sixteen of them
teachers in the Sunday-school. In 1864, in
his address before the society, he said: “At
the beginning of the war there were connected
with the Mariners’ Church a body of young
men, landsmen, who were deeply interested in
the conversion of sailors and enjoyed their
confidence and affection. They, with a single
exception, entered the army. Poor and without
patronage, they enlisted as privates. Five
of them have been promoted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>Those connected with the Mariners’ Church
when the war opened will never forget the
stirring scenes in the church meetings or the
eloquent words of patriotism and faith with
which the pastor bade his “boys” Godspeed as
they went forth into the great struggle. One
Sunday evening in April, 1861, he spoke feelingly
of the impending crisis. He was so
prophetic, outlining so accurately what afterward
proved to be the extent and course of
the secession movement, that many of his
hearers have since thought him to have been
almost inspired. When he had finished, he
requested three of his “boys” who had enlisted,
one of whom had that very day been
admitted to the church, to step to the desk.
Then, amid a scene such as is rarely witnessed
in a sacred edifice, he talked to them personally,
while the large audience showed great
sympathy and the liveliest interest. When the
enthusiasm had reached its highest pitch, he
drew from under his desk three revolvers and
passed them to the young men, bidding them
go forth in the name of God, in a cause which
he declared to be as holy as any that ever a
people contended for. In 1865, referring feelingly
to the services of these young men in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the field, he said: “They departed with the
prayers and good wishes of the congregation.
One of them, but nineteen years old, fell at
Gettysburg; another,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> having been twice severely
wounded, has returned with honor,
and the third, having received three wounds,
and led his company at the storming of
Fort Fisher, still remains a captain in the
service.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Readers will be interested to know that Mr. Kimball,
the author of this chapter, is here referred to.&mdash;W. B. M.</p></div>

<p>The work was often attended by interesting
and sometimes humorous incidents. During
a meeting in the reading room of the Home
one evening an intoxicated sailor created a
disturbance at the door. He wanted to enter,
and had to be held back by force. The meeting
closed, and the “flying artillery,” under
the leadership of Mr. Kellogg, was about
starting for the nine o’clock prayer-meeting
at the rooms of the Young Men’s Christian
Association in Tremont Temple. The inebriate
took it into his head to go too. He was
reasoned with, but without effect. “You
fellows have got a good thing,” said he, “and
I want some of it.” The leader and his “body-guard”
started, and sure enough, the disciple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of Bacchus followed. Mr. Kellogg protested,
but in vain, and finally ordered “the flying
artillery” to take the double-quick. The man
then showed that he, too, could sprint a bit
even if he did happen to be “loaded.” He
managed to keep the party in sight, and although
he met many obstacles and collided
with a horse-car in crossing Washington Street,
he succeeded in landing a fairly good second.
He was not allowed to enter the prayer-meeting,
however, as he was still inclined to be
noisy, but was “held” in an adjoining room.
The young men got him back to the Home
after the meeting, and he again declared it
his purpose to have religion anyhow, in spite
of opposition. Next morning he appeared,
demanded a pen, and with the air of a usurper
of a throne about to banish all who had in
any way opposed him, placed his name upon
the temperance pledge. That evening in the
prayer-meeting he requested prayers. He
gave his heart to Christ, became a devoted
worker, and a year afterward, returning from
a voyage, was found to be still in the faith.</p>

<p>But sinners had to be brought to repentance
ordinarily. They rarely came unsought, like
this poor wayfarer, and thus Mr. Kellogg and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
his helpers always found plenty to do. It
was an inspiring scene when the leader and
his “body-guard” set out for the prayer-meeting
upon the receiving-ship <i>Ohio</i> or
returned therefrom. In going, they usually
met at the Young Men’s Christian Association,
proceeding thence via “Foot and Walker’s
line,” two by two, keeping step to the music
of their own voices. “The Old Mountain
Tree,” “A Life on the Ocean Wave,” and
many other popular songs of the day, as well
as hymns, were sung. Among the favorite
hymns was “Say, brothers, will you meet
us?” It had that stirring chorus, “Glory,
glory, hallelujah.” This was sung a great deal,
and it finally became the foundation of the
famous “John Brown Song,” to the rhythm
of which thousands marched in the great war
for the nation’s life.</p>

<p>No small part of Mr. Kellogg’s success in
this work came from his intimate knowledge
of the seaman’s nature. Sailors are in many
ways peculiar, and in order to be of service
to them a worker must proceed understandingly.
They regard themselves as in a measure
set apart from their fellow-men. One of
them once wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“I am alone&mdash;the wide, wide world</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">Holds not a heart that beats for me;</div>
  <div class="verse">I’ve seen my brightest hopes grow dim,</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">As fades the twilight o’er the sea.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>That Mr. Kellogg understood this loneliness
and had a large sympathy for the men “that
go down to the sea in ships, that do business
in great waters,” these eloquent words of his
well show: “In respect to the great mass of
seamen, they neither own land, build houses,
nor rear families. They neither give nor
receive those sympathies and attentions which
create among men a mutual dependence and
attachment. When they are sick, no circle of
neighbors and friends watch by their bedside
and minister to their necessities, but the walls
of the hospital, if on shore, receive them and
conceal their sorrows from observation. No
kindred follow them to the grave and erect
the memorial stone. They are not, in the
expressive language of Scripture, ’gathered
unto their fathers,’ but they are buried on
the shores of foreign lands, or amid the
everlasting snows of the pole, or in the
abyss of ocean, slumbering in nameless
sepulchres and mausoleums of the mighty
deep. Like the winds that bear and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
waves that break around them, they are the
visitors of every clime, the residents of none....
The knowledge of the community at
large in respect to seamen is too often
gleaned from the exaggerated descriptions of
novelists.... Every man has in his heart
home feeling. It is an old-fashioned thing.
He drew it in with his mother’s milk. He
learned it at his father’s knees. Even sailors
are men. They did not spring from the froth
of the sea, like Venus. They had mothers
and fathers that loved them and prayed for
them. It is the heart makes home. It is
the heart makes friends in the world. The
heart makes heaven.”</p>

<p>Sailors are ever among the bravest of the
brave. Great as is the appreciation of the
American people of the bravery of the men
who lined up behind the guns of our warships
in the great war which kept the Union
whole, it is not half great enough.</p>

<p>Neither can we overestimate their loyalty
in all great crises of the nation’s history. It
was President Lincoln who pointed out the
fact that in all the general defection of the
first period of secession not a single common
seaman proved false to his flag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>In a prayer-meeting at the Mariners’ Church
while the war was in progress a landsman lamented
its effect upon the “Jackies.” A man-of-war’s
man arose and said: “What is war
to me? What is war to my shipmates? It
brings no increase of peril&mdash;only another kind.
We have always faced danger and death and
disease. What is it to me whether danger
comes from storms or from batteries? I can
kneel down between the guns and pray as well
as in my room at the Sailors’ Home.”</p>

<p>For patriotism and bravery wherever shown,
Mr. Kellogg had the greatest admiration.
Besides the large number of landsmen connected
with his church who entered the service,
over two hundred of the inmates of the Sailors’
Home joined the army and more than six hundred
the navy during the war. With many
of these, Mr. Kellogg kept in touch through
frequent correspondence, and looked after
their personal needs. He loved them all. He
often sent necessities and delicacies to his“boys” at the front. In one of the early battles,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
one of the young men of whom mention
has been made as receiving arms at his hands
in a Sunday evening prayer-meeting was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
wounded. He at once visited the hospital to
which the young man had been taken, secured
a furlough for him, provided him liberally
with necessities, brought him to Boston, and
sent him to his home in Maine for a visit to
his father and mother.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Here, again, the reference is to Mr. Kimball.&mdash;W. B. M.</p></div>

<p>The results of Mr. Kellogg’s great work for
seamen were often not apparent. His sailor
parishioners were scattered throughout the
world. In speaking of this, he once said: “If
a person on shore is converted, it immediately
becomes known to a church of perhaps six
hundred members; if he leads a devoted
Christian life, his influence is felt by thousands.
But these Harlan Pages of the ocean, who pray
with messmates, speak good words to shipmates
in the middle watch, maintain a Christian
life on board frigates which have been compared
to floating hells enlivened once in a while by
a drowning&mdash;who writes their memoirs?
What stone records their virtues? What
periodical chronicles their death? They slip
quietly to heaven unnoticed and unknown.
Their bier is a plank across the lee gunwale,
their mausoleum the ocean, their epitaph is
written in water. And when the report circulates
in the forecastles of different vessels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
some old sailor, dashing a tear from his eye
with his shirt-sleeve, exclaims to his shipmates,
‘Well, he has gone to heaven. He saved my
soul, and he would have saved the whole ship’s
company if they had listened to him.’”</p>

<p>The visible results of Mr. Kellogg’s work,
however, were from the first encouraging.
During the winter of 1858, the great revival
was fully felt. Many were brought to Christ.
The next year the interest continued, not
only at the church and the Sailors’ Home,
but at sea. At the Home 276 signed the
temperance pledge and 95 were converted.
Good work was also done at the hospital
in Chelsea. That winter word was received
that four members of the Mariners’ Church
were holding prayer-meetings on board the
<i>Hartford</i>, flagship of the squadron then in
Chinese waters, and that a lieutenant, the fleet
surgeon, a ship’s doctor, a gunner, two midshipmen,
six petty officers, and twenty-five seamen
had been converted. Prayer-meetings
were then being held upon fifteen other men-of-war.
The next year also showed good results.
In 1861, Mr. Kellogg was able to report
seventy-four conversions at the Sailors’ Home,
fifty-five on the receiving-ship <i>Ohio</i>, twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>-eight
at the hospital in Chelsea, thirty-seven
at sea, and a number at the church. Statistics
show the conversion of 725 during his ministry
of eleven years.</p>

<p>The high esteem in which Mr. Kellogg was
held by the other clergymen of Boston was
well expressed in 1862 by Dr. Todd of the
Central Church. Speaking at an annual meeting
of the society from which Mr. Kellogg was
forced to be absent by a serious attack of lung
fever, Dr. Todd said:&mdash;
“I regret exceedingly the absence to-day of
one who is the life and soul of this work in
this city, whose treasured experience, given in
his racy way, is wont to enliven this anniversary.
I regret exceedingly the cause of his
detention. But I may take advantage of his
absence to bear some slight testimony to the
preciousness of the influence which he is exerting.
Apart from his successes among seamen,
for which he is eminently qualified by the
characteristics of his nature, as well as the
tastes of his heart, he is diffusing an untold
influence in other spheres. I presume that
there is not an evangelical clergyman in this
city who cannot gratefully trace among his
people, and especially among the young men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of his congregation, the quickening and healthful
influence of the pastor of the Mariners’
Church.”</p>

<p>A year later the decline in the merchant
marine began to be seriously felt. It was said
to be due to the sale of a large number of vessels
to the English and the change in destination
of others, many going to England and
the Continent which formerly would have
come to Boston and New York. This diversion
of commerce was believed to be due to the
prevailing high rates of exchange. Then, of
course, a great many of the men who had
manned our merchant vessels had been absorbed
by the army and navy. Just before this
decline began, a competent authority had estimated
that throughout the world at least one
hundred and forty thousand merchant vessels
of all kinds were afloat, manned by a million
men, and that one-third of these were under
the flag of the United States.</p>

<p>These changes in our commerce and this
falling off in American seamen greatly lessened
the number of inmates at the Sailors’
Home, and seriously weakened the Mariners’
Church. Then, too, a new element had occupied
Fort Hill and the adjacent streets. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
growth of business was crowding people southward
and westward, comfortable homes giving
way to commercial establishments. These
things, together with an intention which Mr.
Kellogg had long cherished of entering upon
a literary career, caused him to think seriously
of resigning his position. During the summer
of 1865 he did so, and was soon after succeeded
by the Rev. J. M. H. Dow.</p>

<p>The foregoing is but a glimpse of Elijah
Kellogg’s work in Boston. In its entirety,
that work is known only to God and the
Recording Angel. Its influence was widely
felt upon sea and land. Thousands of sailors
upon lonely waters were made happier by it,
and up among the hills, under the trees, at
many a farm-house window, sad faces that
looked out and watched for their dear ones’
coming brightened at the remembrance that
they had been led to Christ through the efforts
of this seaman’s friend.</p>

<p>Mr. Kellogg was a saintly, lovable man,
and but for his modesty, shunning, as he often
did, the leading churches of the day, because
of what he termed their “starch and formality,”
he would have been named and known
among the great preachers of his time.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">William Oliver Clough</span></p>


<p>When and under what circumstances I
made the acquaintance of the Rev. Elijah
Kellogg I do not now recall. The place,
however, was Boston, and I persuade myself
that the time was the winter of 1856-1857,
during what was mentioned in the newspapers
of that day as the “Finney revival.” I was
then an errand boy in a jewelry store, a member
of the Park Street Church Sunday-school
and congregation, and spent many of my
evenings out&mdash;for I slept in the store&mdash;at
the rooms of the Young Men’s Christian
Association, then in Tremont Temple. It was
probably at the last-mentioned place that Mr.
Kellogg came into my life, and now, looking
back over the years that have passed, I
acknowledge that I have cause for gratitude
that I did not resist the love and friendship
that he generously bestowed upon me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Those of us, his friends and admirers, who
recall the dignified manners and solemn utterances
of the good old clergyman of our grandfathers’
days&mdash;on whose approach to the old
homestead we fled like a brood of frightened
chickens&mdash;do not find in him a counterpart.
He was like yet unlike them, and it was the
unlikeness that attracted young people to him
and compelled them whether they would or
no to follow where he led. It was that he
had been a boy&mdash;the old school clergyman
never gave evidence of such weakness&mdash;and
that it seemed no condescension on his part to
be a boy again with boys, when by so being
he could keep them out of mischief and as he
was wont to say “headed up the stream.”
More than this he knew how to “get at
boys.” He had a purpose in it all. Many
boys did not in my boyhood days&mdash;and I
assume that they are the same in all generations&mdash;take
kindly to being told that unless
they turned over a new leaf and joined the
church they would surely go to the devil. Mr.
Kellogg knew this and was ever on the watch
to discover their plans and ambitions, and,
apart from sermons,&mdash;for he could get them
in in the proper place,&mdash;encourage them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
strive for success, while incidentally warning
them of the pitfalls in their path. In a word,
he had an intuitive knowledge of the character
of the person upon whom he would impress
the better way of life, and knew just
how much religious talk he would stand and
still come to him with his burdens and for
advice. His attitude always seemed to be
that religion&mdash;as men profess it&mdash;was in a
large degree dependent upon education in
honesty and sincerity of purpose in the things
that are nearest at hand, in the affairs of
everyday life, that if the twig were but
rightly bent, thus the tree would incline. He
was indeed a reverend schoolmaster.</p>

<p>Hardly a week passed between the date I
have tried to fix and the time I left Boston in
1870, when, if Mr. Kellogg was in the city, I did
not meet him somewhere in his wanderings.
I do not recall that I ever attended services
at the Mariners’ Church on Summer Street,
over which he was for many years pastor, on
a Sunday morning or afternoon. Sunday
evening was the time. It was then that
the larger half of the Park Street Church
boys and girls ran away, as the annoyed deacons
put it, and went to Mr. Kellogg’s meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>ing.
No matter what the weather happened
to be or what the attractions were at home,
the young people into whose lives Mr. Kellogg
had forged his way went where he was
to be found. They had done their duty by
their own church, and they must do their duty
by Father Kellogg; and so it happened that
year after year the Seaman’s Bethel was
crowded to overflowing on Sunday night, the
middle of the house being reserved for Jack,
and the wall pews for the boys and girls. Incidentally,
and always in the right place, the
preacher gave us the advice that was withheld
in social and friendly intercourse. In
an up-to-date way of expressing it, he “got
it all in.”</p>

<p>Father Kellogg, having followed the sea in
his youth, had a good many odd ways of saying
things that were pleasing to us. Here
are some that I now recall:&mdash;</p>

<p>The writer said to him one day: “The deacons
at Park Street are greatly offended because
you take us away from them on Sunday
night, and have expostulated with us.”
“That reminds me of an old couple in our
state” (“our” is accounted for by the fact
that the writer is a native of Gray), he replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>. “The wife was a strapping woman of more
than two hundred pounds and the husband
was a little fellow of not much over one
hundred pounds. She abused him past the
endurance of a block. Her tongue was forever
going. She gave him no rest, no peace.
Some one said to him, ’Why don’t you turn
about and give her as good as she sends?’
and he replied, ’Oh, but it amuses her and it
doesn’t hurt me any!’ And that is how it is
with the deacons and me. The boys and girls
will come to the Bethel just the same.” He
was right about it.</p>

<p>Father Kellogg was standing in his accustomed
place one night in front of the pulpit,
watching the ushers and showing anxiety
through fear that sittings would not be found
for all comers, when, after looking about, he
pointed to one of the pews, and this is what
he said:&mdash;
“Six persons may be comfortably seated in
those wall pews. There are only five in that
pew. Why won’t you take another reef in
your mainsails, ladies, and accommodate one
more?” The ladies blushed and reefed.</p>

<p>One night, when temperance was the theme,
he paused, and directing his conversation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
some boys who were whispering, remarked: “I sometimes wonder how it will be with
young men who cannot behave in Boston,
where there are so many policemen to watch
them, when they get into that far country
where there are no policemen. You’d better
cast anchor, boys.”</p>

<p>This anecdote is on the writer. My companion
was one of the young ladies of Park
Street, and I was feeling just a bit proud of
myself. We were on hand in time, and had
good seats against the wall. Distress came
upon me by reason of new and tight-fitting
shoes. I had slipped them off and put them
under the seat, and was as peaceful and contented
as a bug in a rug. Presently the crowd
came, and there was a demand for seats. Spying
other boys and me, this is how he fixed
us: “Here, John, Thomas, Ezra, Henry, and
William, come this way and sit on the pulpit
steps.” All the other boys started. I kept
my seat. I was in a fix. Then he spoke a
second time. “Come, come, no hanging
back!” Taking the shoes in my hand,
I went as directed. The boys and girls
laughed, and he comforted me by saying: “I sat on the pulpit steps many a time when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
I was a boy. It didn’t hurt me, and it won’t
hurt you.”</p>

<p>One night just before the benediction he
said very earnestly: “I wish the congregation
would exhibit less haste to be dismissed.
When the last verse of the hymn is being
sung, you throw your books into the rack
with a nervous thud that sounds like the
’ram-cartridge’ of a regiment of raw militia.
Kindly hold the books in your hands until
after the benediction.”</p>

<p>On one occasion when he was talking about
politeness as apart from selfishness, this is how
he got back at some of us, “Now I suppose
if you were travelling in a crowded horse-car,
and a tired mother with a baby in her arms,
or a feeble old man with bundles in his hands,
got aboard, you would give up your seat even
if you had paid for it&mdash;but I happen to know
that there are some of your elders who won’t
do it.” I never knew whom he fired that
shot at.</p>

<p>A transient man (speaking in meeting one
night) bemoaned the fact that some of the
tunes to which hymns were sung were theatre
refrains, and unholy. “What!” exclaimed
Father Kellogg, “you wouldn’t give all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
good music to the devil, would you?” The
stranger sat down.</p>

<p>One cold, blustery day Father Kellogg came
to the store on Milk Street where I was employed,
with a tale of sorrow. He had discovered
a sick family. There was no food or
fuel in the house, and he had no money
in his purse. He must raise $3 immediately.
Every one contributed on the instant,
and he obtained nearly $4. There was a
tear in his eye when he went out, and probably
having in mind that some of us
were theatre-goers or billiard-players, or something
else&mdash;he turned to me, and remarked
aside, “Old Satan will be about $4 short to-night!”</p>

<p>It should not be understood from the foregoing
that my recollection of Father Kellogg
and my admiration for him are based on and
began and ended with a few little anecdotes
incidental to evening meetings at the church
over which he was the honored pastor. I
knew him in the broad field, the world. He
frequently spent an hour of the evening with
me at the store which was my only home, and
where half the evenings in the week I was
alone as watchman after closing hours; here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
he often related his experiences as a sailor&mdash;much
of which was afterward woven into his
stories&mdash;and corrected the compositions I had
written as a student at the Mercantile Library
Association then located on Summer Street.
More than this, he knew most of the boys and
young men of the association, and dropped in
occasionally to hear them speak his declamations
and to encourage them in their studies.
Later he was wont to call at my boarding-place,
as he did at boarding-places of other
homeless young men in that great city, to
look after me and make me feel that some
one cared for me. In those years I went occasionally
with him and others to his week-day
meetings at the Marine Hospital in Chelsea to“help out in the singing,”&mdash;as he was pleased
to put it,&mdash;and to more other places than it
would be interesting to mention here. On
most of these occasions he “stood treat” on
soda or ice-cream somewhere on the tramp,
and, as I now discover, was always endeavoring
to keep us interested and out of reach of
temptation. In after years and following my
departure from Boston, I used to find him at
the Athenæum on Beacon Street where&mdash;after
giving up his church duties&mdash;he spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
most of his time when writing his books.
These meetings were the joy and pride of my
life, and from them I always obtained new courage
to persevere in my profession. And here
let me say that of all the boys of 1857-1870
I know of but one who has made a misfit of
life; and over his misfortunes I throw, as I
know Father Kellogg would were he still
among us, the broadest mantle of charity.</p>

<p>Of Father Kellogg as an earnest and inspired
preacher, a consecrated man with a message
to men, and of his greatest sermons, others
may speak. He was a modest and unassuming
man who did not recognize in himself his
full power to move and convince men. Physical
fear stood in the way. He often expressed
himself as greatly embarrassed when
officiating over large and fashionable congregations,
and he said to me, following his magnificent
discourse in a series of meetings at
Tremont Temple, that when he approached
the desk, his knees shook so that he feared he
should fall in his tracks. However this may
have been, he got control of himself before he
had spoken twenty-five words. All of embarrassment
fled before the earnestness of his
words and purpose. It was&mdash;and I speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
with the knowledge that many others consider
his sermon on the “Prodigal Son” his masterpiece&mdash;one
of the greatest efforts of his life.
He realized that he was in contrast with Dr.
Stone, Dr. Manning, Dr. Kirk, Dr. Neal, and
others, and that he must give the best he had.
The sermon made a deep impression upon all
his hearers.</p>

<p>It was a comparative parallel of a brook
and the career of man in weird and forceful
language, in imagery that was entrancing, in
striking passages, and with the lesson every
moment in the foreground,&mdash;man and brook
at their sources, the place of their birth.</p>

<p><i>Morning.</i> He dwelt upon its beauty at
sunrise, and the secluded depths of the forest,
and sought the birthplace of the brook. Then
with the child and the tiny stream he lingered
and dwelt in graceful, dreamy thought, in
which he compared their purity, pondered
upon the dangers and pitfalls beyond, half
undecided whether to venture farther or cease
to be. Having determined that it would be
cowardly to resist destiny, he followed the
murmuring stream, listened to its complaints
and made note of its troubles. It was the
career of man. As it flowed on, and he wan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>dered
beside it, he listened to the song of
birds, the murmuring wind, and found himself
in harmony with things divine. Anon,
the scene changed, the harmony was broken,
the temptation to recklessness was observed
on every hand. The little brook had increased
in strength and commenced its complaining.
It was being bruised against
boulders, rushed over logs and through
chasms, over ledges, alongside of marshes and
across the quicksands of meadows, under
water-wheels and bridges, thrown mercilessly
over precipices and dashed against every substance
in its path.</p>

<p><i>Noonday.</i> He mused with it, gathered
admirers about it and discovered that it entered
into partnership with other streams as men and
women enter into the partnerships of life. He
listened to its whispered songs by day and
sought its harmonies by night, he sympathized
with its fault-finding because of the impurities
which flowed into it from cities and villages, admired
it when it became a broad expanse, and enforced
the lesson of man’s journey through life.</p>

<p><i>Evening.</i> Standing on the shore of the
ocean, the tide receding, he gazed far out
toward the horizon, and in descriptive beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
I cannot reproduce, saw the river meet and
mingle with the sea, losing its identity; saw
the streets of shining gold, the great white
throne and the crown for those who are faithful
unto death.</p>

<p>The outline of one other of Father Kellogg’s
great sermons still lingers in my mind and
attracts my thought. Paragraphs from it are
discoverable in the stories he wrote late in
life. It was prepared for the purpose of presenting
the cause of the Seaman’s Friend
Society before a great convention in the
Boston Music Hall. He was to speak to a
cultured audience of men and women from
all parts of the state, and in the presence of
some of the best scholars and thinkers in his
own profession. He felt that he would be
criticised in comparison with other speakers,
and was therefore determined to do himself
and his alma mater credit, and withal present
his cause, so as to reach the hearts and pocketbooks
of his hearers. I did not hear the
sermon at its original delivery, but later he
used it for the same purpose in the churches.
I heard it at Park Street, and was so attracted
and impressed by its beauty of language
and eloquence when spoken by him that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
went to the Mount Vernon Church when he
delivered it there. This gives the impression
it left upon my mind.</p>

<p>Through the career of one sailor, learn of
many. He pictured the child in the cradle,
the love and hope of a doting mother; followed
him to school, saw him develop in
mind and muscle; sailed cat-boats, set lobster-traps,
and dug clams with him. He talked
and dreamed with him about other lands and
climes beyond the boundary of their vision,
and entered into his hopes and ambition to
become the master of a ship. Passing briefly
over his coasting voyages, he portrayed him
in port surrounded by sharks and bad women,
and in the whirl, where if he listens and yields
to the tempter, he becomes lost to himself and
a sorrow to the mother who bore him. He
spoke of his needs, of the associations that
should environ him, the necessity for a snug
harbor home in every port, and then, when an
able seaman, he accompanied him on a voyage
to a foreign land.</p>

<p>Then he presented, in vivid colors, beautiful,
weird, and awful pictures of the sea such
as no man who has not witnessed them may
discover in the storehouse of his knowledge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
The vessel drifts to-day in a calm; there is
little to do on shipboard, and so, half homesick,
the sailor looks upon the glassy deep as
in a mirror, and sees faces and forms of those
he loves. Meantime, there are omens that
indicate a coming storm, and anxiety is depicted
on every face. Night and the storm!
Then the awful picture of the raging deep;
the vessel climbing mountain waves and anon
pitching into the trough of the sea; the dark
and ominous clouds, the angry winds, the
mingled prayers and supplications of the
crew; the promises of a better life if spared
to reach land, the wreck, the rescue,&mdash;all in
vividness, in rapid and burning oratory that
held a landsman as in a vice, moved him to
tears, and blotted from his mind all else save
the speaker and his theme. Into port, far
from home and kindred, and the old story of
forgetfulness of promises when in the presence
of temptations, and, in conclusion, a masterly
plea for pecuniary aid from those who had
it in their hearts to better the sailor’s
environments.</p>

<p>During the war of the rebellion, Father
Kellogg’s patriotism and zeal for the cause of
his country was of the most pronounced type.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Whenever a regiment from Maine was due
to march through the streets of Boston,
whether outward or homeward bound, his
affection for the old home and the boys of his
state, excited him beyond self-control. He
met the command, if informed of its coming,
at the railroad station, crossed the city with
it, remained close to the ranks and at every
halt talked with and cheered the boys. He
made speeches to several regiments, when
reviewed on the Common, and on one occasion&mdash;I
was present to greet a cousin in the
ranks&mdash;he broke down completely, and wept
like a child. It was pretty safe to say after
the departure of a regiment from Maine that
Mr. Kellogg had not a “penny to his name.”
He made speeches and offered prayers at the
unfurling of the flag, and spoke parting words
of affection and advice to seamen of his congregation
and young men of his Sunday evening
meetings, many of whom “died with their
wounds in front.”</p>

<p>The last of my several visits with Father
Kellogg at his home at North Harpswell was
on August 5, 1899. On my journey thither,
I talked freely with the driver of the hired
carriage&mdash;G. W. Holden, a brother of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
mystic tie&mdash;and said to him: “I should
think the people of such an up-to-date place
as this would demand a younger preacher,
more of a society man than Mr. Kellogg.”
He became enthusiastic at once and replied: “Why, bless you, brother, the people of this
place are all of one mind in this matter.
Like myself they had rather hear Mr. Kellogg
say ’amen,’ than the finest sermon any
younger minister could possibly preach. Why,
people come from far and near to hear him,
and every now and then he has a request
from some of them to deliver his discourse on
the ’Prodigal Son.’ It is a most remarkable
sermon. I could hear it twice a year, and
hunger for a third.”</p>

<p>But here we were at the end of our pilgrimage,
at the very door of his residence. It
was nine miles from the boat-landing, half a
mile from the main highway through a strip
of woods, and in a romantic and secluded
spot; an old-fashioned, unpainted farm-house
of the fathers, with large, high-studded rooms,
and furnishings after the fashion of the city.
Everything bespoke comfort.</p>

<p>Mr. Kellogg met me at the door with warm
greeting, and when he made out my identity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
through the mists of years, embraced me with
the enthusiasm of a child, put his arms about
my neck and kissed me upon the cheek. It
was the same warmth and affection with
which he greeted the old Park Street Church
crowd of young people in good old times.
“Come in! come in!” and then our
tongues were loosed and it was a race for life,
for my visit was necessarily to be brief, to
see who could do the most talking. I think&mdash;mind
you, reader, I am not positive about
it&mdash;that he did the most of it; at any rate
he conjured with names of old-time companions
and friends whom I had forgotten, but
whose faces and forms were instantly upon
the screen before me, and spoke with tenderest
affection of boys and girls, old men and
matrons, whom we had known and loved, and
who have long since paid the debt of nature.
Oh, that the living of the good old times
could have joined me on that pilgrimage!</p>

<p>He told me it was his purpose to proclaim“glad tidings” to men while life lasted; that
he had engaged to preach the next year; that
he expected to officiate on Sunday at Bowdoin
College, and that his health was such&mdash;deafness
being his only apparent infirmity&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
had reasonable hope of becoming a centenarian.
He recalled incidents innumerable with
which I am familiar, and related with manifest
pleasure that the deacons of Park Street
undertook to put a stop to the “running
away” of their young people on Sunday
nights, and, with merriest twinkle of the eye,
said, “their lectures fell on stony ground.
Some of the young people replied that they
were born in the Bethel, others that they
were looking for a chance to sing, and there
were a few&mdash;and I fear you were one of the
number&mdash;who always turned up where the
girls were. Anyhow, I had the crowd, and
I loved every one in it as though he were my
own.”</p>

<p>Then, in softened accent, as though he
feared he had wronged those deacons in
thought and spirit, he said practically this: “Ah, but those same deacons were good and
true men. They were sympathetic, they were
liberal to a fault, and I never went to one of
them for aid in my work to return empty-handed.
Then there was my old friend,
Alpheus Hardy, of the Mount Vernon Church.
I verily believe he would have turned all he
had in the world over to me had I solicited it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>The conversation ran on and on in changing
moods. I feared that Brother Holden and
our lady travelling companion would begin to
think themselves in for a half-day of steady
waiting, and so I began to break away. This
was the hard part of it all. He clung to me
and put his arms about me, urged me to dismiss
the driver and sleep under his roof, and
finally exacted a promise that I would come
again next year, if in that vicinity, and tarry
longer. Our adieus were then spoken, and he
stood upon the porch and waved his hand in
parting.</p>

<p>All that I have here written is, as I view
it, a eulogy on the character and career of
Father Kellogg, and yet I may be pardoned,
considering my long acquaintance, tender
attachment and admiration for the man, if,
as attorneys put it, I sum up:&mdash;</p>

<p>He was one of nature’s noblemen; he was
incapable of deceit; he lived a life above reproach.
His one great purpose was to make
himself useful to the human family. To this
end he sought out boys who were liable to go
astray, and it may be said in all seriousness,
and with impressive emphasis, that he succeeded
in the mission to which he was conse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>crated.
The seed he sowed ripened in the
lives of those in whom it was planted, and,
granting that each in turn confers the same
blessing upon his children, Father Kellogg’s
influence must continue on and on to future
generations, making the world wiser and
better because he has lived in it. His gentle
chidings, his forgiveness of seeming neglect,
his patience when troubles were upon him,
his sympathy for those who were in sickness,
sorrow, need, or any other adversity, his hopefulness
when in financial stress, his devotion
to his invalid wife, his anxiety for his children,
his unselfishness, his never failing cheerfulness
and steadfast faith in God, his
submission by which he ever discovered the
silver lining in the dark cloud, his determination
to preach the Gospel to the end of his
days,&mdash;all, all, have lodgment in my heart;
and so, when I think of him, it is not as of
one dead, but one who lives, lives in the affections
of kindred and friends, in beneficent influence
still abroad in the world, in deeds:
not dead, not dead:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If the gods would give me the desire of
my heart,” exclaims Thackeray in <i>The Roundabout
Papers</i>, “I should write a story which
boys would relish for the next few dozen of
centuries.” This is a glorious immortality
which Thackeray desires for his boys’ story.
Generously have the gods dealt with that
author whose writings for boys have been
relished even a quarter of a century.</p>

<p>Of the stories and declamations of Elijah
Kellogg the past at least is secure. What
boy reader did not relish “Good Old Times”
and “Lion Ben”? What schoolboy has not“met upon the arena every shape of man or
beast that the broad empire of Rome could
furnish, and yet never has lowered his arm”?
The schoolboy of the future will be of different
stuff from the schoolboy of the past if, when
declaiming to his mates on a Friday afternoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
he does not begin in subdued tones and stand,
like Regulus, “calm, cold, and immovable as
the marble walls around him,” and end in guttural
tones and in a fine frenzy with “the
curse of Jove is on thee&mdash;a clinging, wasting
curse.”
“Spartacus to the Gladiators,” the first of
Mr. Kellogg’s eleven declamations, was written,
as has already been said,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in 1842, for one of
the rhetorical exercises at Andover Seminary.
At this exercise there was present a Phillips
Academy boy, John Marshall Marsters. Some
years afterward, when Marsters was to take
part in the Boylston Prize Speaking at Harvard
College, he secured from Mr. Kellogg a
copy of “Spartacus.” In this, as in many
similar competitions, it proved a prize-winner;
and it so won the admiration of Mr. Epes
Sargent, one of the judges, that he first published
it, in 1846, in his “School Reader.”
Since then no school or college speaker has
been deemed complete unless it included“Spartacus to the Gladiators.”</p>

<p>“Regulus to the Carthaginians” Mr. Kellogg
wrote at Harpswell for his friend, Stephen
Abbott Holt, then a student at Bowdoin Col<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>lege,
who first declaimed it in the Junior Prize
Speaking, August 25, 1845; and it was first
published in 1857 in Town and Holbrook’s
Reader. Most of his other declamations were
written for <i>Our Young Folks</i>, and similar
magazines.</p>

<p>As school and college declamations, these
have seldom, if ever, been surpassed. Vivid
in description, stirring in sentiment, alive with
action, dramatically portraying concrete deeds
of heroism, they are especially attractive to
school and college boys. Nearly all of these,
it will be noticed, deal with ancient characters
and events. From the time Mr. Kellogg began
to prepare for college in his father’s study,
he was exceedingly fond of the ancient classics.
He had in his library at the time of his death
235 volumes of the classics of Greece and
Rome. Well versed in Greek and Roman
history and mythology, he could fittingly extol
the patriotism of Leonidas and Decius;
bewail the woes of the Roman debtor; incite
the gladiators to revolt; and appeal to the
Roman legions, or curse the Carthaginians
through the mouth of Icilius or Regulus.</p>

<p>With the exception of a few bits of verse
written while he was an undergraduate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
printed in the college paper, <i>The Bowdoin
Portfolio</i>, “Spartacus” was the first of Mr.
Kellogg’s writings to be published. During
the twenty-three years between 1843, when
he became pastor of the church at Harpswell,
Maine, and 1866, when he resigned as pastor
of the Mariners’ Church in Boston, he wrote
very little that was printed: “Regulus,” an
ode for the celebration of Bowdoin’s semi-centennial
in 1852, and a sermon, “The
Strength and Beauty of the Sanctuary,”
preached at the dedication of the Congregation
Chapel, St. Lawrence Street, Portland,
Maine, in 1858. After 1866, after Mr. Kellogg
was more than fifty years old, came that
rather remarkable period of story-writing.
Uncommon is it for a story-writer not to begin
his career until after he has lived two score
years and ten. That Mr. Kellogg could tell a
tale, however, in a way to interest boys, his college
mates discovered during his undergraduate
days; for those well acquainted with him
in college, as they have recorded their recollections
of young Kellogg, seldom fail to
mention that “he was very fluent in talk,
exceedingly interesting as a conversationalist,
and an excellent story-teller.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>For some time before his resignation from
the pastorate of the Mariners’ Church he had
been thinking of trying his hand at a boys’
story, and in January, 1867, the first chapter
of his first story was printed in <i>Our Young
Folks</i>, a magazine published in Boston by
Ticknor and Fields. This story, “Good Old
Times,” at once became popular with the young
readers of this magazine. It is one of the best
stories that Mr. Kellogg ever wrote. It is
largely a narrative of facts&mdash;the story of Hugh
and Elizabeth McLellan, the great-grandfather
and great-grandmother of Elijah Kellogg, in
their struggle at the beginning of the eighteenth
century to cut a home for themselves
out of the forest wilderness of Narragansett
No. 7, where the town of Gorham, Maine, now
is. Of Scotch-Irish descent, young, brave, and
resolute, “strong of limb, strong in faith, strong
in God,” this couple left their home in the
north of Ireland to escape persecution, poverty,
and famine. They braved the terrors of the
sea and the savages to found a home in the
new country. Accustomed as they had been
in Ireland to regard a landowner as the most
fortunate of men, they deemed it a rare privilege
to secure land in Narragansett No. 7, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
paying “but little money and the balance
in blood and risk and hardship.” They gladly
dared the privations of a savage wilderness to
obtain some soil they could call their own.</p>

<p>Little wonder is it that the story of how
they did this proves of interest to the boys of
New England; it is the story of what their
own grandfathers and great-grandfathers endured,
enjoyed, and achieved. Here, to be
sure, they read of no fairyland peopled with
elves and sprites, with ogres and goblins;
here is no fairy godmother with glass slippers
and pumpkin coaches, but a land of flesh-and-blood
men and women, of real boys and girls,
of Indians with war-whoops, and tomahawks,
and scalping-knives&mdash;all true, but all enchanted
by the wand of the story-teller.
What better fun for the boy reader than to
join this resolute family as they set out from
Portland, and go with them into the primeval
forest; Elizabeth on horseback with a babe in
her arms leading the way, little ten-year-old
Billy just behind driving the cow, and Hugh
with a pack on his back, a musket slung across
his shoulders, and another child in his arms,
acting as rear-guard. Here in the woods were
hard work, peril, and poverty; but here, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
were all kinds of interesting things for a boy
to see and do. To help build the log house,
shingle it with hemlock bark, and stuff the
chinks with clay and brush; to see Hugh make
the big “drives” and prepare for the “burn,”
an exciting and important event in the
making of a forest home; to watch the fire
as it rushed through the clearing, and to lie
in wait, gun in hand, near the woods and
watch the “raccoons, woodchucks, rabbits,
skunks, porcupines, partridges, foxes, and field
mice ’on the clean jump,’ all running for dear
life to gain the shelter of the forest, while a
great gray wolf, which had been taking a
nap beneath the fallen trees, brought up the
rear”&mdash;this was rare sport. To wear leggings
and breeches of moosehide; to gather
spruce gum and maple sap; on moonlight
nights to shoot the coons that were stealing
the corn; to see the men cut and haul the
masts, those immense trees upon which the
king’s commissioner had put the broad arrow,
those trees so large that upon the stump of
one of the largest, so said Grannie Warren,
a yoke of oxen could turn without stepping
off&mdash;this was fun indeed for little Billy.
What boy, as he reads the story, does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
wish that he were the son of a pioneer, even
if the corn and meat did now and then get so
scarce that the McLellans were obliged to dine
upon hazelnuts, boiled beech leaves, and lily
roots. In those good old times, men and boys
were not forced to betake themselves to tents
and camps to get away from our “modern
conveniences,” to test their resourcefulness
and ingenuity in devising ways and means to
secure food and shelter. From the boy’s point
of view that pioneer life was one long, glorious
vacation of “camping out.”</p>

<p>And then there were the Indians, who,
whatever else they did, kept the life of that
day from becoming tame and commonplace.
They furnished, when friendly, no end of entertainment
for the youngsters. What fun
the boys had playing beaver in Weeks’s brook,
and how delicious the venison was when
roasted by old Molly the squaw! Under the
instruction of friendly Indians, Billy learned
to give the war-whoop, to hurl the tomahawk,
and to acquire great skill with the bow. If
he could not, like Robin Hood, cleave a willow
wand at a hundred yards, he could “knock a
bumblebee off a thistle at forty.” And when
Billy was fast coming to man’s estate, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Indians, instigated by the French, dug up the
hatchet that had been buried for nineteen
years; then there was a call for all the coolness,
cunning, and heroism that this pioneer
life had developed in boy or man; then Beaver,
as the Indians called Billy, and his savage
playmate, Leaping Panther, were compelled
to pit against each other their prowess and
cunning. Narragansett No. 7, right in the
Indians’ trail, was the scene of many an encounter,
often bloody and disastrous in those
days, but more exciting than a Captain Kidd
expedition when looked back upon through
the eyes of the twentieth-century boy. Driving
the oxen, with a gun resting on the top
of the yoke, planting and reaping and every
moment expecting to hear the war-whoop,
creeping serpent-like through the grass and
stealing noiselessly under an overhanging bank
in order to discover an Indian ambush&mdash;the
story of all this arouses the heroic in a boy’s
nature.</p>

<p>After “Good Old Times,” from Mr. Kellogg’s
pen the books came thick and fast,&mdash;the
Elm Island stories, the Forest Glen, the Pleasant
Cove, and the Whispering Pine series,&mdash;so
that by 1883 there were twenty-nine in all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>While writing these books, the author lived
in Boston, on Pinckney Street, during the winter,
often supplying neighboring pulpits, and
spent the summer at his Harpswell home.
His favorite workshop was the Boston Athenæum.
Here he often wrote from morning
till evening. One of his college mates has
said: “Kellogg when in college was strenuous
and persistent in whatever he undertook.
I remember when he was composing a poem
or preparing an essay, he gave his whole soul
to it; his demeanor showed that he was absorbed
in it and absent-minded to everything
else, until that one thing was done.” This
power of concentration now stood him in good
stead. Often he worked upon his stories fifteen
hours a day. Upon his “Sophomores of
Radcliffe” he spent a year and a half; but by
making his days long and concentrating his
thought upon the one task before him, he was
sometimes able to turn out a book in three
months.</p>

<p>The style in which these books are written
is not faultless. The participles are sometimes“dangling” or “misrelated.” The uses of“most” and “quite,” of “and which” and
the “historical present,” are not always ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>cording
to the rhetorician’s rules. Flaws may
also be picked with the way some of the characters
are introduced, transitions made, and
statements repeated. But considering the
number of stories the author wrote in these
sixteen years, such mistakes are surprisingly
few. Mr. Kellogg had an ear sensitive to the
flow of a sentence and a memory in which
words stuck. The rhythm of his prose is
noticeably good and his vocabulary excellent.
Well acquainted alike with farmers and sailors,
with mechanics and students, he could put fitting
words into the mouth of each. The language
of his characters does not stultify them:
his carpenters are not fishermen; his sailors
are not landlubbers; his farmers are not caricatures.
He knew well the “down-east” vernacular.
In the use of the dialect&mdash;if such
it may be called&mdash;of rural New England, Tim
Longley and Isaac Murch can give points even
to Hosea Biglow.</p>

<p>All of these books are not of the same merit,
and concerning them boys’ opinions differ.
Next to “Good Old Times,” perhaps the Elm
Island and the Pleasant Cove stories are most
after a boy’s heart. An island far enough out
at sea so that the dwellers thereon cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
easily supply their wants and consequently
have to use inventiveness and daring, is an interesting
element in any story, whether it be“Robinson Crusoe,” “Masterman Ready,” or “Lion Ben.” Although not a tropical land
abounding in cocoanuts, turtles, and parrots,
Elm Island affords abundant opportunity for
boys’ play and boys’ work. “Does such an
island really exist?” writes a mother to the
author. “No,” he replied, “only in my own
imagination.” And yet for many boys it does
exist. There is no need to describe Elm Island
to the boys of New England. They have trod
every foot of it and know its every nook and
cranny. They know that it is six miles from
the Maine coast, “broad off at sea,” and that
in the early days fishermen used to land there
and make a fire on the rocks and take a cup
of tea before going out to fish all night for
hake. They have looked admiringly upon its
rich coronal of spruce, fir, and hemlock, the
large grove of elms on its southern end, and
the big beech tree which often has in it as
many as ten blue herons’ nests at one time.
They can tell you of its precipitous shores,
its remarkable harbor, its beautiful cove into
which runs the little brook where come the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
frostfish and smelts, and where the wild geese,
coots, whistlers, brants, and sea-ducks galore
come to drink. That big rock where the
waves roar hoarsely is White Bull; and this
smaller one, white with the foaming breakers,
is Little Bull.</p>

<p>They know that “it was a glorious sight to
behold and one never to be forgotten in this
world or the next, when the waves, which had
been growing beneath the winter’s gale the
whole breadth of the Atlantic, came thundering
in on those ragged rocks, breaking thirty
feet high, pouring through the gaps between
them, white foam on their summits and deep
green beneath, and&mdash;when a gleam of sunshine,
breaking from a ragged cloud, flashed
along their edges&mdash;displaying for a moment
all the colors of the rainbow.... And how
solemn to listen to that awful roar, like the
voice of Almighty God!”</p>

<p>This island and the neighboring mainland
Mr. Kellogg peopled with likable and interesting
characters. Strong, good-natured Joe
Griffin, beneath whose hat is ever hatching
a practical joke, Uncle Isaac Murch, full of
Indian lore, skilled in the use of tools, always
able to look at things from a boy’s point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
view, Captain Rhines, John Rhines, Charlie
Bell, and old Tige Rhines are dear to many a
boy’s heart. And Lion Ben, powerful, overgrown,
agile, slow-tempered, warm-hearted
Lion Ben! Almost as soon could a boy forget
Leather-Stocking as forget Lion Ben.</p>

<p>Situated as was Narragansett No. 7 some
ten miles inland, in “Good Old Times” Mr.
Kellogg had but little to say of sailors and
the sea. But Elm Island and its sea-loving
people afforded him large opportunity to use
the knowledge of ships and seamen gained
during the three years he had sailed before
the mast, or the twenty he had ministered to
sailors in Harpswell and Boston. He knew
all the pleasures which the sea and shore
afford inventive, resourceful boys like John
Rhines and Charlie Bell. Fishing and swimming,
making kelp siphons, spearing flounders,
shooting coot and geese, building boats and
sailing them into the teeth of the gale&mdash;no
author has told of these more entertainingly.
Mr. Kellogg loved the sea dearly and
knew the words and ways of sailors well. “Here,” says a reviewer, “is an author who
knows just what he is writing about. He
never orders his sailors to lower the hatch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
over the stern or coil the keelson in the forward
cabin.” He liked nothing better than
to build an “Ark” or a “Hard-Scrabble,”
load her with lumber and farm produce, man
her with Griffins and Rhineses, a snappy crew
of home boys, who would “scamper up the
rigging racing with each other for the weather
earing,” and sail away to the West Indies.
Through hurricanes, blockades, or pirates, they
would sail with colors flying, reach their port
in safety, sell their cargo for a handsome profit,
and come back laden with coffee, molasses,
and Spanish dollars to gladden the hearts of
the dwellers on Elm Island and in Pleasant
Cove.</p>

<p>The Wolf Run stories depict characters and
events similar to those in “Good Old Times.”
They tell of the way a handful of Scotch-Irish
settlers in the mountain gorge of Wolf Run
on the western frontier of Pennsylvania, about
the middle of the eighteenth century, built
up their homes; and of the “fearful ordeals
through which they passed in consequence of
their deliberate resolve never with life to abandon
their homesteads won by years of toil
from the wilderness.” Here, as in “Good Old
Times,” is a scattered community of a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
families, frugal and hardy, hating injustice
and loving righteousness, to whom food and
shelter of the rudest kind are luxuries, and
life itself is often at stake. These stories are
full of vivid pictures of frontier life, making
the “birch” and the “dug-out,” devising ingenious
makeshifts for tools and furniture,
trapping the wolf and beaver, building and
defending the stockade. Here are many enlivening
accounts of Indian battles, ambushes,
midnight attacks, hair-breadth escapes, and
long, hard chases on the trail of the Mohawks
or the Delawares. Across the pages of these
stories walk sinewy men of oak, in moccasins,
buckskin breeches and coonskin caps, ready
to fight or fall, keen of eye and lithe of limb,
skilled in forest lore, tireless on the chase,
sagacious in finding or covering a trail, keen
marksmen, “delicate in nothing but the touch
of the trigger.” Sam Summerford, Ned Honeywood,
Seth and Israel Blanchard, Bradford
Holdness, Black Rifle,&mdash;twin brother of Cooper’s
Long Rifle,&mdash;are characters which live
in a boy’s memory. These are stories of strong
lights and dark shades; but they are true to
the life of that day, and show well “what the
heritage of the children has cost the fathers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Whispering Pine stories the author
relates the struggles, achievements and pranks
of a group of students in Bowdoin College.
In these books he has given us a good look
into the lives of students in a small college in
the first half of the nineteenth century, and
has preserved in the amber of his story many
Bowdoin customs.</p>

<p>He pictures vividly the early Commencement,
when nearly the whole District of Maine
kept holiday. From far and near people came
in carryalls and stages, on horseback, in packets
and pleasure boats, to join in the college merry-making.
Hundreds of carriages bordered the
yard, and barns and sheds were filled with
horses; hostlers were hurrying to and fro
sweating and swearing, and every house was
crammed with people. To Commencement
came not only the beauty, wit, and wisdom of
the district, but also those who cared little for
art or learning. With dignified officials, sober
matrons, and gay belles and beaux came also
horse-jockeys, wrestlers, snake-charmers, gamblers,
and venders of every sort. The college
yard was dotted with booths where were sold
gingerbread, pies, egg-nog, long-nine cigars,
beers small, and, alas! too often, for good order,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
beers large. While Seniors in the church were
discoursing on “Immortality,” jockeys outside
were driving sharp trades and over-convivial
visitors engaging in free fights.</p>

<p>In his “Sophomores of Radcliffe” Mr.
Kellogg tells us of the Society of Olympian
Jove, whose customs perhaps sprang partly
from the author’s imagination and partly from
his experience. In those days the initiate
was made to rush through the pines and ford
the dark Acheron, and was carefully taught
the signals of distress&mdash;signals which James
Trafton, with work unprepared, the morning
after his initiation, much to the merriment of
the class, proceeded to give to the irritated professor
by squinting at him through his hand.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting of the early
Bowdoin customs described in these books
is the “Obsequies of Calculus.” This custom
was in vogue many years, and a headstone
can yet be seen upon the campus marking
the spot where the sacred ashes were
consigned to dust. At the end of Junior year
when Calculus was finished, the Junior class
gathered in the mathematical room and there
deposited their copies of Calculus in a coffin.
The coffin was then borne sorrowfully to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
chapel, where amid wailing and copious lachrymation
a touching eulogy was pronounced.
The orator was wont to discourse of the “gigantic
intellect of the deceased, his amazing
powers of abstraction, his accuracy of expression,
his undeviating rectitude of conduct,”
his strict observance of the motto that, “The
shortest distance between two points is a
straight line.” Then came the elegy in Latin;
after which, amid the grief-convulsed mourners,
the coffin was placed upon a vehicle called by
the vulgar a dump cart, and the noble steed
Isosceles, which “fed upon binomial theorems,
parabolas, and differentials, and every bone of
whose body and every hair of whose skin was
illustrative of either acute or obtuse angles,”
drew the sacred load to its last resting-place.
The funeral procession, consisting of the college
band, Bowdoin artillery, the eulogist and
elegist, and the Freshman, Sophomore, and
Junior classes, moved slowly down Park Row,
through the principal streets of the village to
the rear of the college yard. Here the books
were “placed upon the funeral pyre and burned
with sweet odors, the solemn strains of the
funeral dirge mingling with the crackling of

<p>The ashes were collected, placed in an urn,
and enclosed in the coffin. A salute was then
fired by the college artillery. The epitaph,
like that upon the grave of the three hundred
who fell at Thermopylæ, was brief but full of
meaning, having on the tablet at the head,&mdash;</p>

<p>But the Whispering Pine books were written
for other purposes than simply to depict the
life of the college or to let us into the escapades
of the students. The dictum that “all art
must amuse” did not go far enough for Mr.
Kellogg. With all his fun and “frolic temper”
he was too much of a Puritan to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
amusement the chief end of his writing. All
of his stories were written with the avowed
purpose of making boys more robust and genuine
and manly, of giving them redder blood
and broader chests and larger biceps, and at
the same time making them hate gloss and
chicanery and love straightforward, courageous,
Christian dealing. So imbued was the
author with this purpose that he wrote his
books, as he expressed it, “while upon his
knees.” Often at first he felt that he should
be preaching rather than writing stories; and
it was not until letters came to him from all
over the country that he realized he was
reaching more boys with his pen than he could
possibly have reached with his voice.</p>

<p>Although written with a purpose, it is noticeable
that his books are not of the wishy-washy
type. His boys are not Miss Nancies
and plaster saints. They do not die young
and go to heaven; they live and make pretty
companionable kind of men. Mr. Kellogg was
too much of a story-teller and too strong a
believer in truth to distort life for ethical
purposes.</p>

<p>One does not have to delve deep, however,
to find the lessons which this author would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
teach. To college boys his advice is, choose
your chums well. College is not simply a
place where learning is bought and sold, where
you pay so much money and get so much
Greek or so much philosophy. Not all college
lessons are in your books, neither are they all
taught in the class-rooms. You will learn
them on the college paths, in your sports, in
your dormitories; and generally it is your
chums who teach them to you. The set of
fellows with whom you cast your lot may
make or mar you. College ties are strong.
The boys with whom you eat and sleep, those
with whom you solve the difficult problems
and pick out the tangles in Greek and Latin,
with whom you stroll of an evening to the
falls or a Wednesday afternoon to the shore,
to whom you tell your future plans, your love
affairs, and your religious doubts, whose sympathies
mingle with yours “like the interlacing
of green, summer foliage,” those fellows
are going to mould your ideals and determine
your character.</p>

<p>Again, he believed that boys must not be
afraid to lock horns with an obstacle. A
difficult job may be their greatest blessing.
Richardson coddled at home feels himself a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
weakling by the side of Morton whom difficulties
have made self-reliant. William Frost, who
begins a business career with good looks, good
clothes, and parental influence, returns to his
home in disgrace because he “disregards the
claims of others, esteems labor drudgery, and
expects recompense without service rendered”;
while Arthur Lennox, who sets out from his
Fryeburg home barefoot and penniless, his
only inheritance “a strong arm and a mother’s
blessing,” wins success by unflinching toil. “Hardship,” said Mr. Kellogg, “is a wholesome
stimulant to strong natures, quickening
slumbering energies, compelling effort, and by
its salutary discipline reducing refractory elements.”
The boy who is always dodging difficulties
will make a gingerbread man. Only
by grappling can we gain power to achieve.
Only by having tough junks to split can we
learn “to strike right in the middle of the
knot.”</p>

<p>The value and dignity of labor is the ever
recurring burden of these stories. They teach
boys to work as well as to play. Through them
all resounds the merry music of labor. The
ring of the axe, the crack of the whip, the
song of the teamster, the screech of the plane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the ring of the anvil, the swish of the scythe,
the chirp of the tackle, the creak of the windlass,
the shout of the stevedore&mdash;all in these
books make a happy harmony and witness
that man’s primal curse has become his choicest
blessing. Mr. Kellogg believed with Carlyle
that all work is divine, that to labor is to
pray. Especially did he wish to get out of
boys’ minds the false notion that only mental
work is honorable. He thought that often it
is as honorable to sweat the body as to sweat
the brain. As honorable and as necessary; for
he believed that it is only by keeping the lungs
full of fresh air, and the pores open by perspiration,
and the limbs strong by activity,
that a man can keep his vision from being distorted. “The essence of hoe handle, if persistently
taken two hours a day,” would, he
believed, cure many diseases of the mind and
heart. The devils of fretfulness and fault-finding
are not always to be cast out with
prayer and fasting. Often it requires labor in
the fresh open air,&mdash;a good pull against the
tide, a long ride on horseback, or an hour’s
chopping with the narrow axe. Many a disheartened
preacher who now mopes in his
study and who “takes all his texts out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Jeremiah,” would get “Sunday’s harness-marks
erased from the brain,” and preach
glad tidings of great joy if he would only
start the perspiration by healthful, outdoor
exercise. Mr. Kellogg thought a boy should
learn to work with his hands as well as with
his brain. All wisdom, he knew well, is not
in school and college. He appreciated the
value of book learning; but democrat as he was
and well acquainted with common people, he
knew that an illiterate Jerry Williams or an
Uncle Tim Longley can teach scores of valuable
lessons to many a schoolman. The boy
who is too lazy to do some of the practical
duties of life, who thinks it disgraceful to
work with his hands, can have no part or lot
in his kingdom. His boys are always able “to
cut their own fodder.” His ideal college boy
is Henry Morton, who is a keen debater, a
good writer, a lover of the classics and a lover
of nature, but who, at the same time, can hew
straight to the line, cut the corners of many a
farmer, and take the heart of a tree from many
a woodsman.</p>

<p>Elijah Kellogg gave to the boys of America,
at a time when they needed them most, fresh,
wholesome, stirring stories of out-of-door life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
With these stories he both entertained and
taught the boys,&mdash;entertained them so well
that they never suspected they were being
taught,&mdash;taught them endurance, pluck, integrity,
self-sacrifice. He stimulated them to
effort, inspired them with a respect for labor,
taught them to despise effeminacy, showed
them that “the manly spirit, like Dannemora
iron, defies the fury of the furnace, and even
beneath the hammer gathers temper and tenacity,”
that “pure motives, warm affections,
trust in God, are by no means incompatible
with the greatest enterprise and the most
undaunted courage.” Such was his work as
an author, and it was a work worth while.</p>

<h2><a name="LAST_DAYS_IN_HARPSWELL" id="LAST_DAYS_IN_HARPSWELL"></a>LAST DAYS IN HARPSWELL<br />

<small>AS SEEN IN LETTERS AND JOURNAL</small></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wilmot Brookings Mitchell</span></p>


<p>Mr. Kellogg accepted the call to the
Mariners’ Church in 1854, not because he
had tired of his Harpswell farm or pastorate.
They were as dear to him as ever. But
fitted by nature and by experience to work
among sailors, he saw in the Boston pastorate
increased opportunities for doing good.
Doubtless, too, financial considerations had
their weight in this decision; for he had been
unable to pay for his farm, and he hoped
from the larger salary he would receive at
the Mariners’ Church to save money enough
to cancel that debt. While he was in Boston,
he did not sever his connection with his
Harpswell parish. Each summer he spent
some time on his farm and preached a Sunday
or two at the church. And now and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
these people would see him in the winter,
when some special errand of love or of
business called him hither. At such times
they were reminded that the city was not
spoiling their minister, but that he was the
same unique, unselfish, fearless man.</p>

<p>On one November, for example, he appeared
at “Uncle” William Alexander’s with two
sailors. These men, who had been dissipated,
he had persuaded to sign the pledge. He
feared, however, that if they went off to sea
at once, they would forget their good resolutions
and fall back into their old ways
of drinking. They tried to get work in
Boston and failed. At length they said if
they only had a boat, they could fish for a
living. Mr. Kellogg thought of his own
twenty-five-foot boat, and at once they set out
for Harpswell to get it. The morning after
their arrival a northeast wind was blowing a
gale, kicking up a rough sea. Mr. Kellogg
doubted the feasibility of starting for Boston
in such a gale. Whereupon the sailors
questioned his courage! They did not know
their man. “Don’t dare to, eh? We’ll see
who dares.” Quickly making ready, he set
out in his little boat, while his old neighbors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
knowing his absence of caution or of fear,
prophesied disaster. By the time the boat was
off Cape Elizabeth, the old sailors were begging
their captain to make harbor. But no;
they must see who dared! When, cold and
drenched, they reached Gloucester that evening,
they had fully decided never to stump the
sailor-preacher again.</p>

<p>From 1865, when he resigned as acting
pastor of the Mariners’ Church, until 1882
Mr. Kellogg continued to reside in Boston,
busily engaged in writing his books and in
preaching. During these years he supplied
pulpits at Wellesley, Massachusetts (1867),
Cumberland Mills, Maine (1869), Portland,
Maine (1870), and Pigeon Cove, Massachusetts
(1874-1875). To the Warren Church at
Cumberland Mills, the Second Parish Church
at Portland, and the Congregational Church
at New Bedford he received calls; all of which
he declined.</p>

<p>In 1882 Mr. Kellogg came back to Harpswell
to live for the rest of his life. He had
worked hard in Boston and had made there
many firm friends, but a large city was not the
place for one who loved the smell of earth as
well as he. He had often told his Harpswell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
friends that if he could consult only his
own wishes, he would rather pass a winter
in a brush camp built on the lee side of
William Alexander’s stone wall than return
to Boston. Like many another, “he found
himself hungry to throw aside the tame and
trite forms of existence and to penetrate the
harsh, true, simple things behind. His imagination
and his heart turned towards the
primitive, indispensable labors on which society
rests,&mdash;the life of the husbandman, the
laborer, the smith, the woodman, the builder;
he dreamed the old enchanted dream of living
with nature.”</p>

<p>Though glad to return, Mr. Kellogg came
back to his first parish a poor man. His
books had made his name known throughout
the United States, but fame and the consciousness
of having done much good were his only
remaining proceeds from years of writing.
By the fire of 1872, and the consequent failure
of his publishers, he had lost money that
he could ill afford to lose. Pressed for funds,
he had even been obliged to sell all his copyrights,
with one exception&mdash;that of “Good
Old Times.” He came back to his Harpswell
home in debt, his farm run down, blindness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
threatening his wife, deafness and old age
beginning to creep upon him. But his old
grit and courage were still left; and he found
his Harpswell friends unchanged, they and
their children eager to welcome him back and
to help him in every way they could. As
General Chamberlain so well shows in the
next chapter, he went to work with a will
to do his best,&mdash;farming, preaching, going
wherever duty called on errands of charity
and consolation.</p>

<p>These were undoubtedly hard years. His
struggle with debt was often embarrassing;
his growing deafness caused him anxiety; and
in 1890 the death of her who had been his
companion and counsellor for more than forty
years bowed him in grief. His son and daughter
besought him to come and make his home
with them. But that was not his way. He
must stay in Harpswell and do his work.</p>

<p>Between 1883 and 1889 Mr. Kellogg preached
in the neighboring town of Topsham, driving
up Saturday afternoon and returning Monday
morning. In 1889 he came back to his old
pulpit, and there, in the church that had been
built for him, he continued to preach, until he
died, on March 17, 1901, with this message to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
his faithful flock upon his lips, “I want to send
my love to all these people.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Journal.</div>

<p>As one reads the journal which Mr. Kellogg
kept during these years of struggle, “the years,”
as he called them, “of the right hand of the
Most High,” one feels that out of the struggle
came a character which ease and plenty could
not have given him. His boyish enthusiasm,
his ready wit, his fun and humor, are all
here; and here, too, is the faith of one who
walked as seeing the Invisible. He indeed
proved the promise, “To him that overcometh
will I give to eat of the hidden manna.”</p>

<p>His abounding gratitude, his childlike faith,
his willingness to put his hand in God’s and be
led of Him, his love for his people, and the way
prayer and deed were beautifully intermingled
in his life, may be seen on every page that he
wrote during these last years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May 29, 1882.</div>

<p>I have kept the day as a day of fasting and
prayer. I have been called by the church to
go to Harpswell. I dare not refuse to go; at
the same time I do not see how I can go....
I have this day endeavored to cast my burden
on the Lord, feeling that as He has sent me to
Harpswell, He will provide me with a way of
getting there and enable me to do my necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
work. And I have resolved to trace and set
down the different steps by which I am led
and to mark the finger of God in them all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sabbath,
June 18,
1882.</div>

<p>I have preached half a day and the people
seemed to make much effort to get to meeting,
and seemed, I thought, very tender.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 2, 1884.</div>

<p>In the evening went to see &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; and
had a most pleasant evening. I believe I can
do good in that family.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 17,
1884.</div>

<p>This afternoon I went to the college. Found
a new student, Morton, who comes to meeting,
and he invited me to his room. Saw B&mdash;&mdash;
and gave him a hint about his soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 18,
1884.</div>

<p>I had my barley on the ground and by working
through the afternoon and getting to Topsham
the last moment could have sowed it, but
my conscience told me that was not in the
spirit of the resolutions made the Sabbath
before. Corrupt nature said, “It is duty to
get your bread.” I was enabled to say, “Corruption,
go about your business, my business
is with God.” I went to my knees, made
preparation for the Friday night meeting, and
was enabled by grace, on a pleasant, sunny
afternoon at four o’clock, to turn my back
cheerfully on my work and go to Topsham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">June 28,
1884.</div>

<p>I finished sowing barley to-day, and I knelt
down on the ground and prayed to God that
as I had used my own judgment to the best
advantage, had taken the advice of others, had
worked diligently, and had not neglected my
duty to Him that He would be pleased to bless
this crop sown so late and under so many disadvantages
and give me from it some good
returns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 26,
1885.</div>

<p>Rose early. Prayed with my wife, provided
for her comforts, and started for Topsham.
About four or five inches of snow, the first of
the season, all blown in heaps, the ground
frozen, wind northeast by north. A cold ride.
Got to the Baptist house in time.... I thank
God I have done my duty. I have since coming
home prayed for Harpswell and have been
to the old willows and to the rock in the field
and thanked God. Oh, my God, I thank Thee
that I have for the first time since my mother
died eaten a Thanksgiving dinner in this
house, and the first time since I was married,
all the intervening winters being spent in
Boston and Thanksgiving observed in a hired
house. I ate Thanksgiving in this room with
my blessed mother for whom I built this house,
to provide a happy home for her in her old age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
in November, 1849, thirty-six years ago, and
have never eaten a Thanksgiving dinner here
with my wife till to-day, though we have been
married thirty-one years; and never with my
children who were born in Boston where we
have resided since our marriage with the exception
of the summers spent here. But I
have never formed any attachment to Boston.
Here is my home. I cut the greater part of
the timber of this house with my own hands,
had a hard struggle to build it, and a harder to
keep it. I thank God this night I am in it
once more. God give me a grateful heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 27,
1885.</div>

<p>I have been wont to kneel at the threshold
when I went out in the morning for the first
time. It seems natural, loving, and right in
every way to ask God’s blessing the first thing
before touching the world’s work, and when
I do it, the day’s efforts always seem successful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 29,
1885.</div>

<p>God in great mercy has relieved me of my
cold and given me an exchange at Harpswell,
so that I preached to my old people. I have
had a fire in my study, read my mother’s
Bible, visited the old willows, the rock, the old
maple, the Skolfield barn, the burnt tree, all
my old praying spots, and read over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> “record of the years of the right hand of the
Most High.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">May 19,
1886.</div>

<p>Went to the old pine, read the Word at the
foot of it, and prayed for wisdom. It did me
good. My heart warmed to the spot. Went
to Knowlton; he was very kind, left his recitations,
and got me the book I wanted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 4, 1886.</div>

<p>Rose at six-thirty. Prayed and gave thanks.
I strove to put myself into the hand of God.
Mr. Little came for me in a chaise. We went
to my father’s old church where I prayed and
pronounced the benediction. At two-thirty we
went to the city hall. About two thousand
people were there. I spoke twenty-one minutes
to the apparent satisfaction of those who listened
and those who brought me here, and
the friends and benefactors who have stood by
me in my trouble. I call upon my soul and
all that is within me to bless the holy name
of God who has turned this thing I so dreaded
into an ovation, and has given me strength,
patience, and perseverance to prepare for it
under the pressure of work and still not
neglect anything.... I thank God that in
this city where I was born, where my father
preached so many years, I have received from
the city authorities so much respect, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
sending a carriage for my wife and me, honoring
me as his son, and fulfilling the promise
of a covenant-keeping God, who declares that
He will show mercy unto those that love Him
even unto the third and fourth generations.
I cannot express my feelings of gratitude that
I who so tried him and my mother have been
made by God the means of honoring their
memory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 6,
1886.</div>

<p>Rose early. Prayed and gave thanks. A
carriage was sent to take my wife and me to
the city hall to listen to the oration by
Hon. Thomas B. Reed. I was given a seat
beside him. From there we went to a clam
bake on Long Island, and there I met and
had much talk with Phillips Brooks. In the
evening we went to the last meeting, which
consisted in a general talk on reminiscences.
Thus has closed this Portland centennial. I
have here received the most kindly attention,
not only from religious people, but from the
civil authorities; have been introduced to a
great many people who have read my books
and who have spoken “Spartacus,” Phillips
Brooks among the rest. I now humbly thank
God and ask Him to keep me.... Went
to see Mr. Ezra Carter; he is confined to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
bed. He was very glad to see me. There
was not time to see him and go to my parents’
graves where I wanted to thank God for the
manner in which my father’s name had been
honored in me. But Ezra Carter has been
my friend for years. He helped me put my
father in his coffin, and was for years his
friend, and therefore, as I could not do both,
I thought it would be more acceptable to God
to comfort the living than to pray at the
grave of the dead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oct. 19, 1886.</div>

<p>Oh, how great is the goodness of God to me!
I have been to-day keeping thanksgiving in
my closet and in the sanctuary; though having
extra duties, I have found much time to
pour out my soul in thanksgiving to God.
I have been looking back upon the sea of
providential mercies and noting the most prominent
ones, but oh, it is all mercies. The trials
have brought forth mercies. I should never
have known what God is if He had not known
my soul in adversities. He has been around
my path in the daytime, my couch at night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 7, 1886.</div>

<p>This has been to me a most interesting,
peaceful, and solemn Sabbath. It is with us
a day of Sacrament. At the conference yesterday
I chose this subject for my remarks:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> “Open thou thy mouth and I will fill it.”
It touched every chord of my soul. Indeed,
I have of all persons to open my mouth wide,
for my necessities are very great. The purport
of the whole text and context is that of
a Being so magnificent in all His attributes,
so infinite in His fulness, that we may, and
are encouraged to, ask great favors. And
on the strength of it, after looking over the
record of God’s mercies in my journal for
the past six years, I went to the altar where I
have administered the communion and threw
myself upon the mercy of God and opened my
mouth wide and asked Him for His name’s
sake through Christ to put me in a way of paying
my debts that are such a dishonor to His
cause, as I have consecrated my labor to Him
and work only for daily bread and to pay my
debts.... I also asked Him to grant me
His Holy Spirit to interpret aright the indications
of His providence, for I surely do not
wish to be a revelation to myself. I cannot
judge of their bearing on the present or the
future. His written revelations would be a
sealed book to me without His spirit, and so
will the unwritten of His providence. I can
see that preparation for another year may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
have very important bearing on my stay here
and on my attempting to write a book: two
things which have sadly perplexed me, and
which I am waiting and praying for the providence
of God to solve, as He has by His providence
solved so many other things and brought
me out of so many difficulties which in prospect
seemed insurmountable. I feel now glad
that Mr. Kendall did not come for me to
preach at Bowdoinham, though I sadly needed
the money; for I feel that I have seen my
Father’s face, and I mean to mark the way by
which He leads me and take every step with
prayer. God, in mercy withhold me from attempting
or even desiring to work any deliverance
of my own. I now prepare for the
evening service.... I have just returned.
The meeting was full of young people. I certainly
have no reason to complain of my
audience, though they may have of me. God
bless them. I do not dread this week so
much as I did. God grant my first thought
may be directed to Him. Glory to God for
this pleasant Sabbath.</p>

<p>Rose early, prayed, and gave thanks. Hauled
in the forenoon all the rocks required. Mr.
Getchell finished at noon. In the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
I took him to Brunswick, paid him, got my
lime and sand, and got home by dark. I have
knelt down beside the wall that is now finished
and humbly thanked God for doing this
kindness to me, for He has done it. Blessed
be God for the mercies of this day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oct. 25, 1887.</div>

<p>Rose early. Prayed at the hearthstone and
the threshold. John came. We sawed, split,
and hauled the wood. The old house windows
surprised him. We then prepared the horses,
and at noon John went home. Though
pressed with work, I felt prompted to go to
the burnt tree and went to that and to the
old maple and thanked God and prayed for
little Frank. Made my fires and the company
began to come. They poured in with full
hands and warm hearts to the number of
eighty or more. Surely God’s dealing with
me in most unthought-of ways. Glory to God
for the mercies of the twenty-fifth of October.</p>

<p>This has been the day of the National Fast,
but has been more of a thanksgiving than a
fast to me, although I have abstained from food
and striven to humble myself before God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 25,

<p>Went to the Skolfield barn, prayed, and then
with a tackle and much contrivance put my ox
cart on the scaffold. I then took the wheels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
from the axle, and stowed them and the axletree
away below. It took me a long time,
and was hard work. William and his boy
and myself would have done it in ten minutes,
but as they thought and said I could not do
it, I did. If it had been twenty years ago, I
should have got help; but a person situated as
I am&mdash;in debt, and having to begin life anew&mdash;must
not show any sign of failure of strength
or energy. I did it not for vanity but on calculation,
as a duty. Especially is the sin of
old age fatal to a minister.... I am now
going to treat myself to a little agricultural
reading.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to Dr.

<p> ... I am well and can preach and work
and do all that I ever could, but I have become
deaf so that I cannot do anything in a
social meeting.... My people have retained
their affection for me as strong as ever. It
was a love match at the beginning, and so it
has continued; the children and grandchildren
have followed suit. I never have regretted
going to Harpswell, and I do not regret that
I wrote the books; for if I have reaped
nothing, I have abundant testimony that I
have scattered good seed in virgin soil....
I am more than glad that I learned to farm in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
my youth, and that I have all these years
kept up my habits of labor, that I can do any
kind of farm labor and take care of cattle, for
otherwise I should not at this time have a
place to put my head.</p>

<p>I am writing you to-night before an old-time
open fire, and I cut in the woods the
fuel which feeds it. I am thankful that
deafness is no bar to labor nor to writing. If
it were not for the illness of my wife, I believe
I should write a book this winter....
I send you with this letter a copy of the Commencement
number of the <i>Orient</i>, by which
you will see that Bowdoin boys feel their oats
and have aspired to govern themselves. May
God bless old Jeff, and may his shadow never
grow less.</p>

<p>You may be assured it is from no lack
of affection or sympathy with you in your
mishap that I have not written before, but a
complication of circumstances, some of them of
a very sad nature, has rendered it impossible.
In the first place, I strained my heel cord
either by jumping out of the wagon or by
wearing a very tight congress boot, and had
to limp around for about ten days, but am all
right now. Don’t you think, the second night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
it was done, just as I was going to bed, two
men came from Bailey Island for me to attend
a funeral the next day at two o’clock. I told
them it was impossible as I could with greatest
difficulty hobble to the barn. They said there
was no minister in town but me, and if I did
not go, the person would have to be buried
without any service. Upon that I told them
to go to John Randall’s and tell him to come
over in the morning, and take me to the intervale
point where they must meet me with a
boat. John came; we rode to the point.
John took me in his arms and put me into
the boat. When we were across, two men,
one on each side, led me to the house; when
we got to the doorstep one of them said, “Mr. Kellogg, do you think you will be able
to preach?” I replied, “Put me before the
people, and the Lord will tell me what to
say.” The next morning my foot and leg
were swollen to the knee, and I could not get
on a rubber boot, but had to wear arctics....
I am all right now, however, and carried a
bushel of apples on my back to-day.</p>

<p>I put the harness on the colt this week for
the first time since the 10th of last August, the
week before I was hurt, and he behaved so well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
that I had to give him some sugar. I have
cleaned him all up, combed his hair and washed
his face, and he goes to school every day. He
is a strapping great fellow and full of grit.</p>

<p>It is a rainy evening and I take it to write
to you. Yesterday was a most lovely day. I
went to George Dunning’s to dinner. Frank’s
wife gave us a splendid dinner,&mdash;turkey, pudding,
pies, and fruit, grapes and oranges. Betsy
was quite disappointed; she meant to have
me, but Frank got the start of her and invited
me about the middle of the month. I let
Delia go home right after breakfast, and told
her I would get my supper. I came home
from George Dunning’s about three o’clock,
took care of the cattle and got an early supper,
and had a long evening alone; that was
just what I wanted and was planning for. I
never can feel that Thanksgiving Day should
be all taken up with eating and merriment.
I never spent a happier evening than I did
last evening in looking over the year, and in
praising God for what He has done for me. I
have food, fuel, and clothing, and food for my
cattle that have come to the barn in excellent
order. Let us be grateful. Gladness is not
always gratitude.</p>

<p>I have been to Brunswick and preached to
the students in Memorial Hall. I will send
you and Mary both a notice of it. There are
two magazines and you can exchange them.
I feel quite happy that I have got through
with the students. They checkmated me. I
did not want to go and did not mean to,
but Dr. Mason, the minister at Brunswick,
and President Hyde wrote me and backed
them up, and also the Brunswick people who
gave me a good deal at the donation and
have for several years followed suit; I had
to give in. I was afraid I should not be
able to see in the evening, as the hall is very
large and I have been preaching in a small
house for two years; but there was no trouble.
It was a splendid light and I had the service
all in my own hands; no responsive readings.
The students did the singing and gave me
two anthems. After it was all over, I had to
shake hands with twenty-five or thirty, and
President Hyde said he could hear every word.</p>

<p>The town has made a road to the Lookout.
They are going to build a wharf in the spring,
and the Mere Point boat will run there. It
will be of no benefit. It will bring a Sunday

<p>I am glad you are having such good weather,
and that you are enjoying yourself setting out
fruit trees. You can see now why it is that
I am so much attached to this spot. I have
been through just what you are going through
now. I am eating the fruit of the trees I
have planted and grafted, and am sheltered
by them in the winter and sit under their
shadow in the summer. Such labors attach
us in a most singular manner to the spot we
have improved. The trees seem almost like
children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>You ought to have been here to take supper
with us last night. I got a peck of large
clams. Fannie baked the most of them and
we set to work tooth and nail. I never ate so
many before in my life at one time. I was
almost afraid to go to bed, but I had a good
night’s sleep and experienced no trouble. We
have had very cold weather till the last week
when it has been moderate. Until last Thursday
I have not been to Brunswick since the
week before Christmas. The Sundays have
been so stormy that we could not have meetings,
and I never preached my New Year’s
sermon till last Sunday which was a very
pleasant day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>I have before me two letters both from
different places in New York State and from
men who have made their mark in the world,
who attribute their success in life to the influence
of my books. I had almost made up
my mind to send them to you. Such letters
do me good. I at one time used to fear that
I had done wrong in devoting so much time
to writing that might have been given to
preaching the Gospel, but I have of late had
so many letters of this kind that I feel differently,
especially when I consider how many
more persons a book reaches than a sermon.</p>

<p>I have never been so pleasantly situated
since my great loss in parting with your
mother as I am now. I have food, fuel,
raiment, and health. There has not been a
Sabbath since I was hurt that I have not
been able to preach, nor a single day in the
week that I have not been able to take care
of my cattle and do all my work. I am sure
this is something to thank God for. It is
wealth without riches. Is it not something
to thank God for to have so many friends,
so many to love you and wish you well, and
feel that you have been able to benefit them?
When I looked over that assembly of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
hundred and twenty-five persons last fall at
the donation, many of them the grandchildren
of old friends, and when I look at Fannie
sitting here ready to anticipate all my wants,
and doing all in her power to make me happy,
and think here is the grandchild of Pennell
Alexander, one of my earliest and best friends,
I feel that life is worth living, at least for me.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago, Alcott Merriman died and
left four young children fatherless and motherless.
He was a great friend of mine, and I
kept run of the children. Fourteen years ago
Irving, the youngest, was taking me down to
Potts’s, and I entered into conversation with
him and urged him to give his heart to God.
He received it so kindly that I began to pray
for him and the other three boys, Alcott, John,
and Paul Sprague, and have prayed for them
ever since some time every day. Alcott was
converted and is a member of my church;
Irving was taken very sick a few months ago.
I went to see him and found that he had not
forgotten the conversation fourteen years ago,
and was then praying for himself. I became
intensely interested in him. I wanted him to
get well. I asked my church and many others
to pray for him, that God would forgive his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
sins and raise him up. I went to see him
every week. He lived almost down to Potts’s
and the going has been bad. God did not see
fit to raise him up, but He gave him a new
and wonderful peace of mind. I wish you a
happy New Year....</p>

<p>Perhaps you recollect Mr. McKeen, the
president of the alumni of Bowdoin College,
who introduced me at the centennial. He
sent <i>The Outlook</i> for a year and five dollars
as a Christmas present. He is the man who
owns Jewel’s Island. It seems to me as if
God had been with every step I have taken
all this month. Everything I have put my
hand to has prospered. I have my whole
winter stock of wood under cover. Since I
was injured I have always ridden to the
afternoon meeting, but all this month and part
of last I have walked. My fodder corn held
out till the tenth of November. I have plenty
of hay and my people seem to love me better
than ever. I hated to part with the old
year; it has been a pleasant year to me....
The missionary society got so poor in the hard
times that they gave notice that they must
cut down twenty-five per cent the churches
which they helped, but they did not cut me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
down; was not that remarkable? Thus you
see I have a Shepherd who watches over me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to

<p>Though I have not written to you for a
long time, you have seldom been out of my
thoughts. I never had so many engagements
as of late,&mdash;funerals, weddings, and letters
that must be written. There were two persons,
a brother and sister by the name of
Chaplin from Georgetown, Massachusetts, who
have visited here several years and have
always been very constant at meeting. They
were here the first Sunday in August when I
preached in the old church where I preached
my first sermon to the Harpswell people fifty-five
years ago. At Christmas they sent me
a most kind letter and a present of handkerchiefs
and neckties. I think I will send you
the letter that you may know what friends I
have among the summer visitors....</p>

<p>George Dunning is dead. I shall miss him
very much; we have been near neighbors and
friends for more than half a century. There
were seventy-five persons that got together,
hewed out and raised the frame of my house
when I came here to live, and George Barnes
and Stover Pennell are all that are left of
them....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>Deafness is a great deprivation; it cuts me
off from exchanging and going from home to
preach. I go up to the college, but President
Hyde sits beside me and keeps me from making
blunders. I wanted to give up preaching
three years ago, but our folks said they had
rather hear me pronounce the benediction
than any one else preach a whole sermon. I
thank God for the love of my people even to
the third generation.... I went to Betsy’s
Thanksgiving to dinner, spent the rest of the
day in praising God for the great measure of
strength He has given me this winter and
courage to face the weather and do a good
deal of work; also for the help He has given
me in hard places.... Thus I had a most
happy day with my Maker and Benefactor
who has held the tangled thread of my life
all these years, who has by His providence
preserved me from perishing in some of those
harebrained, presumptuous freaks into which
my reckless nature led me. I look back upon
it all with astonishment and with gratitude.
I can hardly realize that I once tied up one-fourth
of a pound of powder and the same
quantity of saltpeter and sulphur, and because
the fuse I had fastened to it would not ignite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
held it in my fingers and put a fire coal to it
with the other hand. I was fearfully burnt;
all the skin came off from my face, hands, and
throat. But God had some better use for me
when that courage was needed in His service.
God bless you, my child!</p>

<h2><a name="REMINISCENCES" id="REMINISCENCES"></a>REMINISCENCES</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain</span></p>


<p>A student coming to Bowdoin College
in 1848 found the fame of Elijah Kellogg
already among historic traditions, shading
somewhat into the atmosphere of legend and
the heroic. Wild stories of his youthful exuberance,
and the surprising ways he had of
manifesting it, involved so much that was
extreme in prowess and peril, that they led
more to wonder than to imitation. An unusual
quality and combination of intellectual
gifts, and a quaint style both of utterance
and action, together with an openness of heart,
and ease of manner quite peculiar to himself,
gave him the reputation both of a genius, and
of a queer genius.</p>

<p>His writings, too, had a peculiar effect that
set him apart from others. So much of his
stirring power had been poured into his classic
descriptions that they were something like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
storage-batteries of manly emotion. Whoever
of the prize declaimers took “Spartacus” for
his performance was pretty sure to take the
prize also, whoever were the judges; and
it came to be deemed not quite fair for a
contestant for the prize to make this his
selection.</p>

<p>These stories and associations connected
with his name gave a certain glamour to the
idea of him before his personal presence
showed how real he was. But surely to those
who were disposed to enjoy all the advantages
of college life, Elijah Kellogg was far from
being a mythical personage. Although a
well-employed minister of a church in the
congenial neighboring town of Harpswell, he
found frequent occasion to visit the college;
and preferably, it seemed, at unappointed
times. He did indeed, occasionally upon
notice, address the religious societies, greatly
to their enjoyment and spiritual edification.
But he did not come into classrooms with
formal introduction by the dignified professor.
More likely his visit would be at a private
room, and his announcement by a simple
knock, known by its frankness and assurance,
at any time and at any student’s room he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
thought he wanted to see. This was the signal,
not for a general clearance, as would be the
case in certain other instances, but for the summoning
of a little group of special friends and
those ambitious to become such. This was the
beginning of free and wide discussion along the
unmeasured circle of the <i>nihil humani alienum</i>.
It need not be said that these communications
were held in a noble range, and a thoroughly
manly and wholesome tone. Sometimes, such
was his confidence in us, or distinct intention
of putting us each on his own responsibility,
as to taking easy occasion to make fools of
ourselves, that he would get upon the recital
of old sea stories, and perhaps touch lightly
on his boyish pranks in college. The element
of personal courage, strength, self-reliance, the
despising of physical danger whether of accident
or consequence, lifted these examples out
of the suggestion of meanness and trickery,
which were far from him as he would have
them far from any friend of his. Moreover,
without the robust qualities of mind and nerve
which characterized the original, no boy would
be foolish enough to be led to imitation which
would surely end in failure and ridicule. All
that was said or intimated in these recitals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
was always with loyalty to the college and to
the ideals of manliness.</p>

<p>If these symposiums were prolonged so far
into the night as to render inexpedient his
questionable return to his Harpswell domicile,
it was easy to find a bed in a college room
for such time as there was remaining before
morning prayers. As to that matter, at the
house in town of more than one hard-headed
old sea-captain there was always ready just at
the head of the stairs, with doors unlocked, a
room set apart for Elijah Kellogg.</p>

<p>In the opinion of all he was the good genius
of the college. The fellowship he held there
was of a higher order than that pertaining to
the arts and sciences; it was in the department
of sound living and straightforwardness.
Not only was he the friend of every student,
but he was especially so of those who needed
some guidance or correction inspired by sympathetic
understanding and directed by practical
good sense. For the faculty he served
an office in the disciplinary line not easily
described,&mdash;call it adviser, mediator, mitigator,
or demonstrator of applied common sense.
He had an idea that parents sent their boys
to college to be made to stay there and per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>form
their duties and work out their best,
rather than to be sent away when any little
thing went wrong with them. Still he admitted
exceptions.</p>

<p>One of the recognized degrees of punishment
in those days was that of “rustication,”&mdash;country
residence being supposed to be a
balance or compensation for some of the tendencies
of the pursuit of the fine or liberal
arts within a college town. This was applied
to cases not quite deserving of technical “suspension”;
but still was in fact removal from
actual attendance on college exercises, whether
required or prohibited,&mdash;a forced residence at
the home of some scholarly and judicious
gentleman, where the attractions would be
wholesome influences rather than dangerous
temptations, and where the pupil might receive
instruction in the three branches of
learning pertaining to a classical course, and
thus be enabled to do what seemed less likely
within college walls,&mdash;to keep up with his
class.</p>

<p>Such were the peculiar qualities of Mr.
Kellogg that these temporary sojourns with
him were much in fashion at that time, and,
it is truth to say, rather sought for by those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
a little backward or wayward. Borne on the
college books as a grade of punishment, it
certainly was not of the vindictive, but of the
reformatory, or rather, the sanitary character.
In either aspect, to the delinquent “student”
this punishment was by no means clothed with
terrors. To take up such familiar relations
with a man of stalwart manhood, who never
lost his sympathy and love for youth, and had
the faculty of putting every one at his ease
and at his best, to say nothing of the provision
for needful exercise by going out often with
an able seaman in a stout Hampton boat,
braving the terrors of the seas, and the beauties
of the islands of Casco Bay,&mdash;this should
bring a boy whose forces were not yet knit
together in just balance, to his best of body
and heart and mind, and to some clearness of
purpose and steadfast resolution.</p>

<p>When after three years the writer of these
lines returned to the college as professor, Mr.
Kellogg appeared in a new phase. The young
wife had known him under this higher aspect
during her girlhood association with mature
and cultivated people. So we met now with
a broader intellectual horizon. His opinions
on theological, public, and political questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
were rather conservative, but they were illuminated
by his warm heart. His presence
was cheering in the home as in the college
room. He was a good adviser on practical
questions of life&mdash;for other people!</p>

<p>When the War of the Rebellion threatened
the existence of the Union and some of us
went out for its defence, we looked to see him
take the field or the seas for the honor of the
flag under which he had sailed. But he saw
his duty otherwise. He was not even drawn
by the considerations which appealed to some
of our brightest college men, to take service
as paymaster in the navy. With so many
men gone forward, he thought he had a duty
to the homes.</p>

<p>After the war, when circumstances brought
the relater of this into more responsible positions,
our acquaintance became yet closer.
He let himself be seen at his best, and also in
his deeper needs. He had done a great and
honored work among the sea-faring men in
Boston, and he had written many right-minded,
bracing books for boys which have gone the
world over. All, however, from a singular
course of mishaps, brought him more fame
than fortune. He had held on to his old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
place and church relations in Harpswell; and
thither he returned. His old people welcomed
him back and gave him their hearty support.
But with all that could be reasonably done,
his income could not overtake his outgo. He
was in the position of Paul in the storm, with
four anchors out of the stern, wishing for the
day.</p>

<p>But he had a good little farm on Harpswell
Neck, a long way off the main road but with
a fine outlook on the bay. With some strange
freak,&mdash;an abnormal desire for seclusion perhaps,&mdash;he
had shut off his front view by
planting a thick hedge of black-spruce trees,
effectually concealing his home from the bay
view whether from without or from within.
This black belt, however, served to mark the
mouth of the channel for those of us obliged
to make port farther up the bay, or good
anchorage ground before his door for those
who were bound to see him even if they had
to carry intrenchments.</p>

<p>Well understanding the meaning of the old
Antæus fable, he thought to recover strength
by contact with the earth. He betook himself
to his farm. No man ever worked harder
at this or more completely conformed to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
demands. City friends, of the learned professions,
were not always considerate of his
conditions and the pressure of his “environment.”
One Saturday evening just before
sunset, and a shower rapidly coming up, he
was in his barn pitching off a load of hay up
to the “great beams,” with two loads more
to get in before the shower, when the “girl”
came running out of the house calling, “Mr.
Kellogg, Mr. Kellogg, there’s two ministers
come, and I think they mean to stay to supper!”
Strong stories are told about his
remarks on this occasion; but when questioned
as to the truth of them, he would
neither affirm nor deny.</p>

<p>With his honesty and sincerity he did not
think it necessary to change his working suit
when he came to Brunswick for exchange of
farm products for commodities. His classical
friends could scarcely recognize him trudging
through the streets accompanying&mdash;not driving&mdash;his
contemplative oxen. More easily
recognizable was he when, homeward bound
and fairly out of the village, he would spur
them to a brisk trot, and enter port as suited
him well, on the jump, with “very rag of
canvas flying.” At times, when under press<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>ure,
he would drive to town with a peculiarly
endowed colt he had raised, whose inclination
to freedom and independent “rustication”
seemed to have well qualified for a degree in
the liberal arts. On one of these voyages the
demonstrations in these directions were of such
centrifugal order as to dislocate the normal
relations of horse, harness, wagon, and driver,
and even the continuity of some constituent
parts of the respective latter three, leaving
wreck and confusion behind, and nothing to
get home whole but the colt. Mr. Kellogg’s
friends earnestly advised him to sell the colt;
but to no avail. He seemed to like the colt
better than ever; whether because of the
colt’s facility of “high action,” or from the
force of classical studies, applauding the victor
in the game, or perhaps from that tenderness
of heart that would not forsake a sinner.</p>

<p>With all his love for the beautiful Birch
Island just across the narrow channel of the
bay, which he had begun to frequent when
a college boy, he had an inclination&mdash;or
what the French call a “penchant,” both a
leaning and a drawing&mdash;toward the wild
and odd. This had led him to carry his boat
voyages around to the east side of Harpswell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
amidst some very bad ledges and boisterous
seas, across to Ragged Island. This has only
a little boat-harbor, and is so difficult of access,
so storm-lashed and grim, that it was believed
to have been, if not still to be, a resort for
those who had reason to avoid the customs
officers and agents of the courts, and not less
implacable creditors. A curious impulse to
know more about such a place led Mr. Kellogg
to make acquaintance with this weird
fastness in the seas, and the very eccentric character
who at that time made his dwelling there.
It is said that he even bought a half interest
in the island. Many queer stories have come
down from that passage in his experience,&mdash;chiefly
of his quickness at repartee when some
self-sufficient wight thought to pose him with
a sea-dog witticism; and of his skill in restoring
strong, rude friendships so quickly broken
by some fancied disregard of the extreme sensibilities
of the longshoreman’s personal code.
His influence upon that class of men was wonderful,
owing to their absolute faith in his
integrity and absence of self-seeking. As to
his Ragged Island proprietorship, whether he
sold out or was sold out, the result would
be about the same to him. It was possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
such business ventures as this which deepened
the embarrassment in balancing his accounts.</p>

<p>In the course of this varied struggle things
came to such a pass that he made known his
condition to some of his most intimate friends.
His farm was heavily mortgaged,&mdash;in fact for
about all it was worth,&mdash;and the mortgage
note was overdue and payment rigorously
demanded. His home was in danger, and
he seemed quite broken up about it. In a
very private way this payment was provided
for, and the mortgage taken off. It was a
day of deep revelations when this burden was
lifted, and he returned to a home which was
in the dispensations of both law and gospel
his own. Nor was it any great surprise to
hear it said that it was mortgaged again not
long afterwards. That would be the natural
outcome of habits he indulged in, of which a
characteristic story may be an example. His
self-forgetfulness was of so obvious a character
that his neighbors saw fit to provide a fine
new overcoat to cover one mark of this deficiency.
Putting it on one cold day soon afterwards
to drive to Brunswick, he met a poor
fellow, gaunt and thin as to flesh or other cov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>ering,
poking his way down the Neck to something
he called home. Plain greetings were
exchanged, when Mr. Kellogg exclaimed rather
than questioned, “Tom, haven’t you any better
clothes than that!”&mdash;”No, Parson Kellogg,”
came the apology, “I hain’t got no others at
all!” Off came the new overcoat, with the
Kellogg outcome, “Take this, then; you need
it more than I do!” throwing it over him and
driving out of reach of the astonished man’s
protest, left to the necessity of keeping the
garment for the present, and the possibly not
disagreeable reflection that it would be of no
use to try to give it back at any time. The
absolute verity of this story in every detail
has not been vouched for; but the fact of its
general acceptance among the people shows
that it was true to nature,&mdash;that is to say, “Just like Elijah!” Anyway, the story goes
to prove his recognized character.</p>

<p>All this time he was strictly keeping up his
faithful ministry among his faithful Harpswell
people; doing good to everybody he
met, preaching stanch old-school sermons
with irresistible logic, enlivened by brilliant
flashes of wit and flights of poetry and heart-reaching
illustration; a familiar and welcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
visitor in every house, holding the confidence
and love of every home, sharing joys and
griefs, intrusted with innermost experiences;
smiled at in some sense or other by all who
saw him; respected and revered by all whom
he knew, whether of his fold or of some other,
or perchance without any fold, astray, and,
but for him, lost.</p>

<p>His public ministerial work knew no limit
but that of the hours of the day. After his
own church service it was his practice to meet
every opportunity to speak to the people on
neighboring shores. Not only was his boat
seen threading the channels among the eastern
Harpswell Islands that made part of his
far-outlying, conglomerate parish, but pushing
its way across the western bays to Flying
Point, Wolf’s Neck, and Freeport,&mdash;the track
of this life-message more kindling to the
thought than the thrilling vision of the funeral
boat-train faring to these same places
named in Whittier’s weird poem of “The Dead
Ship of Harpswell.”</p>

<p>The people among whom Mr. Kellogg came
to minister had marked and interesting characteristics.
Natural advantages for seafaring
business in all its variety had in early times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
brought to these shores settlers of a robust type.
Among them were many who, at that period
when minds and bodies were so astir in the
old world and new over questions of life, religion,
and the social order, sought a change
of place that they might find scope for their
abounding energies and unchanging purpose.
These were strong characters&mdash;men and
women&mdash;strong in body, mind, and heart,&mdash;and,
it must be said also, in political and
religious faith. This implies originality, independence,
diversity,&mdash;the outcome of which
is not a tame common likeness in the elements
of a community, but differences which when
properly harmonized give strength to the
social structure. These leading spirits organized
their likenesses and differences into a little
republic, based upon integrity, and by mutual
service tending to the common good realizing
what was best in the ability of each. They
prospered. Many a noble old homestead
stands to-day on these island fronts and headlands,
testifying to the uses they made of this
prosperity. These characteristics appeared in
their descendants down to the third and fourth
generation.</p>

<p>It was the holding together of this society,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
the harmonizing of these elements, and bringing
out their power for good, that made the
inspiring and noble work for Elijah Kellogg.
With a warm heart for all; the quick recognition
of every worthy trait of temperament
or habit; taking in the sorrows of others with
sincere sympathy; tactful in dealing with
weakness or defect; tolerant of differing belief
or profession; fearless of adverse expression or
hostile force,&mdash;he went straightforward in his
work. He was appreciated. Most of those
he dealt with were in one way or another seafaring
men; builders and owners, masters and
sailors of ships; men of wide experience, who
had seen the world, who had endured hardships,
who had well carried great responsibilities;
the women, too, accustomed to enlarging
thoughts and sympathies.</p>

<p>These were a people worthy of such a man
as he was of them. His sound instruction
and faithful exhortation impressed such minds.
Strong doctrine, largely on the lines of the
old Pilgrim faith, propounded, pondered, and
at least respected, meets and makes such
characters. The untiring effort to apply these
principles in the practice of daily living,
instilling these elements into the springs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
action and fibre of character, inculcating the
test of right and sense of honor for the rule of
social intercourse and endeavor,&mdash;out of all
this comes a mighty result in the course of
years. For three generations in that steadfast
old town he stood at the gates of life.
Birth, baptism, marriage, and the passing over
we call death,&mdash;none of these was held quite
acceptable to God, or blessed to the full for
any, unless Elijah Kellogg were the usher.
To the last days of his life, he was summoned
from near and far by descendants of these
families to perpetuate by this token the covenant
of the inherited blessing. His influence
is still powerful in the sterling character of
that community, of which it is not too much
to say that it is typical of the best American
citizenship.</p>

<p>One interesting custom kept up to the last
was that time of all good gifts and greetings,&mdash;the
annual “donation party,” or reception, for
Mr. Kellogg, at that home of ample welcome,
dear “Aunt Betsy” Alexander’s, his oldest
and nearest neighbor. What gatherings were
there! What types of strength and beauty!
What harmonious contrasts and balancing of
youth and age, of soberness and mirth, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
brooding memories and forward-looking, untested
promise! And all owing so much of
their worth to this one man.</p>

<p>In his latter years Mr. Kellogg was more
an object of interest than ever. The inroads
of advancing age did not reach his mind and
spirit. He stood up in his old church and
gave strong sermons,&mdash;some of them quite
likely the same as had been given to other
generations, but equally applicable and wholesome
now. People came long distances to see
and hear him. Summer visitors at neighboring
resorts kept the circle of admirers undiminished
and filled the church on Sundays.</p>

<p>He was often sought for to go elsewhere for
one more greeting. At the great meeting of
the graduates at the centennial of the college,
he was entreated to be one of the announced
speakers. His modesty and real diffidence
would not allow him to assent. But, as might
be expected, he was sought out in some of his
old haunts within the grounds, and brought
in by acclamation. His was the best speech
among them all, which bore hearts away to
the unseen bonds of fellowship and the continuity
of college life and power.</p>

<p>In the very closing days of his activity&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
in the mingling of the twilight and the dawn&mdash;he
was persuaded to address a meeting of
friends from neighboring towns held in the
spacious auditorium in Merrymeeting Park, by
the riverside in Brunswick. Over against the
solid physical force of the vast assembly he
stood with the aspect of an already disembodied
spirit; but in clear tones, as of a voice from
heaven, he delivered his message, in that
marvellous, all-entreating discourse, “The
Prodigal Son.” Those of us who stood near,
almost dreading lest the winged words should
bear him away, saw by the gleam of his eye
what joy it was to that great heart of faith,
and hope, and love, that his last commission
might be to point out the way by which the
wilful, unworthy wanderer, with belated penitence,
might find the Father’s House.</p>

<p>It does not seem quite natural to close
these reminiscences without expressing thankfulness
that the last decade of years brought
the long-cherished friendship within even
closer bounds. With a summer home on the
site of one of the great old shipyards came
the good fortune of becoming one of Mr.
Kellogg’s nearest neighbors. After life’s toil
and trial, its strifes and storms and perils, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
sat down within hailing distance on shores
sloping toward each other, looking over quiet
waters. It was a time of boats again; and
their message was still of glad tidings. It
seemed but an easy row across the mile of
bay, with him on the other shore. Thus was
more than renewed the old habit of hospitalities
and symposiums. The dreams of youth
had been interpreted; its faiths tested; its
hopes and fears overpassed; only its heart
unchanged. We knew what we were talking
about now; and there was much to say. On
Sundays we walked together the well-worn
paths to his familiar church with boyish
embrace, caring not if any thought it strange.
Then, too, meeting at the bankside of dear
friends departed, with his words the last of
earth.</p>

<p>Now the black spruces stand in mourning;
but our hearts go on with him. His boat is
still on the sloping shore, pointing seaward;
so does his cherished spirit help to bear us
over.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Casco Bay as seen near the Kellogg Homestead, Harpswell, Maine.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Through nearly threescore years what
blessed work was his! And his reward is not
wholly on high, although it will be so in the
consummation. But here and now and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
years to come is a great part of it, in living
power in the hearts and souls of men and
women walking worthily in this world, letting
their light also shine to illumine the path for
others still. Who can estimate the value, the
power, the reach, of a work like this? Faithful
friends are earnest now to set up a monument
to mark the place of his forth-giving
and to keep the memory of him fresh; but
the whole world is not too wide to look for
the place of his power, and the memory of
him belongs to the eternities.</p>

<h2><a name="A_TRIBUTE" id="A_TRIBUTE"></a>A TRIBUTE</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Abiel Holmes Wright</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>[On Tuesday, March 19, 1901, funeral services for Mr.
Kellogg were held at the Harpswell church. At these services
Professor Henry L. Chapman officiated, and spoke to
the Harpswell people of the work and character of their
beloved pastor. A choir of Bowdoin College students,
members of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, sang appropriate
hymns. On the next day services were held in the
Second Parish church of Portland at which Rev. Abiel H.
Wright, pastor of the St. Lawrence Street church and an
intimate friend of Mr. Kellogg, delivered the following
tribute, and Rev. Dr. George Lewis of South Berwick offered
prayer. The burial was in the Western Cemetery, Portland,
where are buried Mr. Kellogg’s wife and father and mother.]</p></blockquote>


<p>In one of the pastoral psalms God’s thought
and feeling concerning the death of his consecrated
servants find this expression, “Precious
in the sight of the Lord is the death of
His Saints.” When the aged saint comes
home from the toil and trouble of his earth-time
services, there is joy in the heart of the
Eternal Father. Angels rejoice when one
sinner repenteth and the life of faith is begun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
on earth, but when the sinner becomes a saint
and the long weary trial-way is trodden
through to its end, when, as the Lord sees,
His servant’s work is done, and he is received
on high into the saints’ everlasting rest, then
indeed the death of His saint is precious in
His sight.</p>

<p>Fifty-seven years ago Elijah Kellogg began
his life ministry as a preacher of the Gospel
in the humble village of Harpswell Centre,
where a few days past it was ended. What
minister of Maine has ever been more widely
known and loved by its people than was this
saintly and revered preacher? As a young
man of thirty years but recently from Andover
Theological Seminary, he began his
ministry among the Harpswell people; as an
aged saint of God, nearly eighty-eight years
old, known and loved far and wide in our
land, he closed that ministry in his death,
among the people he had seen grow up from
childhood to declining age. He had baptized
the children of those who were his first parishioners.
He had buried the parents and in
many instances the grandparents of those who
loved, revered, and supported him during the
last years of his laborious ministry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>If we ask why he remained among them,
when called to other and more inviting fields
of labor; why, when this honored Second
Parish invited him to its pastorate in the time
of its strength and prime, he declined to leave
the little country church of forty or fifty
members, the answer is, because he loved the
Harpswell people. They were his first love,
and they were his last love. Highly privileged
people! God-blessed church! To have
had this holy man of God living among them,
passing by them continually, speaking God’s
truth to them, serving them in their homes,
their fields, their boats, their sanctuary, in the
Christ-spirit of devotion, and living out his
rich, fruitful life of faith among them to its
end, content and satisfied to have their love and
gratitude, and with his dying breath speaking
his last loving benediction upon them every
one. It has been a beautiful life of service,&mdash;a
noble ministry for God and humanity.</p>

<p>We have often wondered what Elijah Kellogg
would have been had he chosen to take
his father’s pulpit, and the position and the
prominence which it would have given him in
our city and throughout our state. It might
possibly have made of him a grander preacher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
than he was&mdash;and few are the preachers that
ever came to Portland pulpits who drew larger
or more satisfied congregations than did he;
it might have made of him a more influential
clergyman in our state than he was.
But who will say he could have developed a
grander character or won a fairer fame than
now belong to him?</p>

<p>Elijah Kellogg was a man of deep and fervid
piety&mdash;a man of prayer. There are guest
chambers in our city where his voice has been
heard in prayer for hours at a time, the memory
of which is a benediction. There is a
chamber on Munjoy Hill, in which I have
often slept, which Elijah Kellogg frequently
occupied as the guest of one of his former
Harpswell families. In that chamber he
wrote parts of many of his surpassing juvenile
stories, and there he prayed often and long.</p>

<p>Being a man of prayer, it was his wish and
will to abide where God would have him. It
was God’s will that of the fifty-eight years of
his ministry, the Harpswell people should
have his service nearly all of the time for
forty-three years, and part of the time each of
the remaining fifteen years. During the ten
years he was minister of the Seaman’s Bethel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
in Boston, as chaplain of the Seaman’s Friend
society, he spent his summer in his Harpswell
home, preaching and ministering to the
people. Counting out the five years of his
Topsham pastorate, we may say that his
connection with the church of Harpswell
Centre was practically unbroken for fifty-three
years, and during his pastorate in Topsham
he continued to dwell in his Harpswell home.</p>

<p>His work in Boston brought out one
prominent characteristic of his ministry: his
interest in and love of young men. Elijah
Kellogg was every man’s friend, but he was
preëminently the friend and helper of young
men. As he delighted to write books for
boys, which helped them to become right-minded
and true-hearted young men, so he
aimed in preaching and by personal effort to
reach and save young men. He did so conspicuously
in Boston. At the time when Dr.
Stone was pastor of Park Street Congregational
church, Mr. Kellogg was preaching in
the Mariners’ church of that city. At that
time Dr. Charles G. Finney was at work as a
revivalist with Dr. Stone. Rev. Mr. Kellogg
had been, and was then and subsequently, in
the habit of meeting a class of young men in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Dr. Stone’s chapel. From among those young
men he trained Christian workers and led
them down into the slums of the North End
to help him in his work of holding meetings
on the wharves.</p>

<p>One of those young men I knew years
afterward, who devoted much of his spare
time aiding Elijah Kellogg in his good work
among the tempted classes of the North End.
Two years later that young man came to
Portland to live. He became a worker, then
a member, of the St. Lawrence Street church.
When Mr. Kellogg was back again in Harpswell,
this young man was a prominent merchant
and politician, and a well-known
Christian worker in this city.</p>

<p>At the dedication of the new St. Lawrence
Congregational church in 1897, Mr. Kellogg
made two memorable addresses, in one of
which he alluded to the lamented Henry H.
Burgess, who had died in 1893, in these
words: “When I was preaching in Boston,
Henry H. Burgess was the bookkeeper for a
paint and oil firm in that city, and a member
of the Park Street Sunday-school. I was
preaching at that church, and saw that the
people were sending out old men to gather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
the young men into the Sunday-school. I
told them they would never do any good in
that way, and asked them why they did not
send out young men to do this work. They
said they did not have any young men to do
it, and I said I would get some of them for
the purpose. I preached one sermon, and the
first Sunday after that I walked fifteen young
men into that Sunday-school, with Henry
Burgess at their head, and the next Sunday
in came twenty more, and so on, until finally
the building was crowded to its utmost
capacity, and we had young men to work for
us.</p>

<p>“When Henry Burgess came to Portland
from Boston, I gave him a letter of introduction
to Dr. Carruthers. He is no longer
here,” continued the aged speaker, while tears
of emotion coursed down his bronzed cheeks, “but though absent in the body, he is rejoicing
here with us in the spirit.”</p>

<p>They loved each other, this aged minister
and that strong young man, and they were
helpful to each other. They have changed
eyes and clasped hands, now, I believe, in the
eternal home of the saints.</p>

<p>It was during Mr. Kellogg’s life in Boston,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
in his home on Pinckney Street, that he wrote
his marvellous books for young people. Is
there here man or woman, young man or
maiden, who has not read them and received
from them moral tone and stamina? Perhaps
it is true to say, and no discredit to Mr. Kellogg
to say, that he was more widely known
as author than as preacher, and that he has
probably done more for the moral health of
American youth by his breezy, fascinating
books than by his work as preacher and pastor.
Yea, he has been a mighty preacher to
young Americans by the eloquence of his
industrious pen.</p>

<p>It would, I believe, be difficult to find an
author who wrote with a more definite and
practical aim to Christianize young people
than did Elijah Kellogg, or one who had better
success in the attainment of his high and
noble purpose. Mr. Kellogg possessed a genius
for that kind of literary work. That he
had, in early years, the latent art of an accomplished
rhetorician was proved in his student
days, when he wrote and declaimed “Spartacus
to the Gladiators,” while in Andover Theological
Seminary. It is well, doubtless, that
Mr. Kellogg’s literary genius was directed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the humbler, yet more practical and serviceable,
art of writing books for the moral and
religious culture of the young.</p>

<p>As a preacher Mr. Kellogg was great, both
in the art of making and in the forceful
presentation of the sermon. Rhetorical finish
and enlivening humor were alike natural and
easy to him. I never have heard a preacher
who seemed more thoroughly to enjoy the
effort of preaching, and few preachers excelled
him in the ability to make his audience enjoy
the sermon. How quickly could he change
the amused interest of the congregation in the
play of his humor into serious and solemn
emotion by the power and pathos of his forceful
appeals, applying the teaching of his sermon
to the conscience and the heart.</p>

<p>He was a man of quick and responsive sympathies.
His whole life was characterized by
the spirit of Christian benevolence. He not
only gave himself to his people to be ever and
always their servant in things spiritual, but as
truly in things temporal. He was their counsellor
and helper in all their heavenly and
earthly concerns. It was the habit of his life
to keep a purse for the Lord, into which went
one-tenth of all moneys received by him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Thus he furnished himself, systematically,
with the means to extend aid to those whose
sufferings appealed to his sympathies. It is
said that he gave beyond his means, and often
to his own embarrassment. His services as
a preacher were in constant demand, from
churches far and near, and he responded when
he could. Not a few churches have been
blessed by his labors, at different intervals,
during his Harpswell pastorate. Here in
Portland he was greatly beloved. For nearly
one year he was the continual supply of the
St. Lawrence Street church, and in the
thought of its older members he is regarded
as one of its pastors. Portland claimed him
as her own. He preached at Cumberland
Mills, at Wellesley, Rockport, and New Bedford,
Massachusetts, and in other places he has
served the church of God. The Congregational
church in New Bedford extended to
him a call, as did this Second Parish. But
he refused all such calls, being unwilling to
make any final severance from his beloved
Harpswell people.</p>

<p>In 1889, after the close of his Topsham
pastorate, he resumed full pastoral care of the
Harpswell church, which had been served by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
others during his work elsewhere, and there
he remained until God called him home. It
was a wonder to us all how this venerable
man, with the infirmities of extreme old age
creeping upon him, could still keep on preaching
in his eighty-eighth year, two sermons each
Sunday, and ministering as a pastor to his
flock.</p>

<p>His last visit to Portland was during “the
Old Home week” in August, 1900. He
opened the festivities of that notable week by
preaching Sunday morning in this Second
Parish church, upon invitation of its pastor,
and preaching again in the evening of that
day at Yarmouth; returning Monday morning
to the residence of his niece in the old
homestead of his honored father, the first
pastor of this Second Parish church, who died
in that historic house on Cumberland Street
in 1842, aged eighty years.</p>

<p>Elijah Kellogg married, after the age of forty,
Hannah Pomeroy, the daughter of the Rev.
Thaddeus Pomeroy, pastor at Gorham, Maine,
from 1832 to 1839. Two children survive this
union, both residing in Melrose Highlands,
Massachusetts, Frank Gilman Kellogg and
Mary Catherine, the wife of Mr. Harry Batchel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>der.
I was called to officiate at the funeral
service of their mother in the Cumberland
home referred to, and rode to the grave with
her sorrowing husband. Returning from the
cemetery, the aged, grief-stricken man, said, “Now I will return to my home to be alone
with my God.” His words have been living
in my memory ever since. They implied that
he was sure of finding the God of all comfort
in that secluded and desolated home on Harpswell’s
shore. Who doubts but the God we
love dwelt there with his aged servant,
strengthening and supporting him in his loneliness
and sorrow?</p>

<p>His children desired greatly to have their
father with them in their pleasant homes, but
he chose to dwell among the people whom
God gave him to serve unto the end. “I will
die in the harness,” he would say, in answer to
their appeals. I have from the lips of his son
the words of the last prayer he was heard to
offer some days before his death. “I thank
God for a Christian mother, who consecrated
me to Christ and the Christian ministry,”&mdash;the
prayer was followed by his repeating of the
twenty-third Psalm.... Just before Elijah
Kellogg passed away from earth, he delivered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
this touching message for his Harpswell flock, “I want to send my love to all these people.”
Having loved his own, like his dear Lord, he
loved them unto the end. Yesterday the
message was delivered to them by Professor
Chapman in his funeral discourse. The very
last words of this venerable man of God, this
faithful shepherd of God’s people, were, “I
am so thankful.”</p>

<p>Let us not attempt to interpret the words;
they teach us that his Christian heart was
overflowing with gratitude to God. He was
dying in a good old age, his children around
him, his people near him. He was gathered
to his fathers after a long, faithful, heroic,
and noble life. He leaves with us a most
precious and a most blessed memory. Our
hearts, too, are full of gratitude to God for
the life of Elijah Kellogg on earth.</p>

<h2><a name="DECLAMATIONS" id="DECLAMATIONS"></a>DECLAMATIONS</h2>


<h3><a id="SPARTACUS_TO_THE_GLADIATORS"></a>SPARTACUS TO THE GLADIATORS</h3>


<p>It had been a day of triumph in Capua.
Lentulus, returning with victorious eagles, had
amused the populace with the sports of the
amphitheatre to an extent hitherto unknown
even in that luxurious city. The shouts of
revelry had died away; the roar of the lion
had ceased; the last loiterer had retired from
the banquet; and the lights in the palace of
the victor were extinguished. The moon,
piercing the tissue of fleecy clouds, silvered
the dewdrop on the corselet of the Roman
sentinel, and tipped the dark waters of Volturnus
with wavy, tremulous light. It was
a night of holy calm, when the zephyr sways
the young spring leaves, and whispers among
the hollow reeds its dreamy music. No sound
was heard but the last sob of some weary
wave, telling its story to the smooth pebbles
of the beach, and then all was still as the
breast when the spirit has departed.</p>

<p>In the deep recesses of the amphitheatre a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
band of gladiators were crowded together,&mdash;their
muscles still knotted with the agony of
conflict, the foam upon their lips, and the
scowl of battle yet lingering upon their brows,&mdash;when
Spartacus, rising in the midst of that
grim assemblage, thus addressed them:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ye call me chief, and ye do well to call
him chief who, for twelve long years, has met
upon the arena every shape of man or beast
that the broad Empire of Rome could furnish,
and has never yet lowered his arm. And if
there be one among you who can say that,
ever, in public fight or private brawl, my
actions did belie my tongue, let him step
forth and say it. If there be three in all your
throng dare face me on the bloody sand, let
them come on!</p>

<p>“Yet I was not always thus, a hired butcher,
a savage chief of still more savage men. My
father was a reverent man, who feared great
Jupiter, and brought to the rural deities his
offerings of fruits and flowers. He dwelt
among the vineclad rocks and olive groves
at the foot of Helicon. My early life ran
quiet as the brook by which I sported. I
was taught to prune the vine, to tend the
flock; and, at noon, I gathered my sheep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
beneath the shade, and played upon the shepherd’s
flute. I had a friend, the son of our
neighbor; we led our flocks to the same pasture,
and shared together our rustic meal.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">“One evening, after the sheep were folded,</span><br />
and we were all seated beneath the myrtle
that shaded our cottage, my grandsire, an old
man, was telling of Marathon and Leuctra,
and how, in ancient times, a little band of
Spartans, in a defile of the mountains, withstood
a whole army. I did not then know
what war meant; but my cheeks burned, I
knew not why; and I clasped the knees of
that venerable man, till my mother, parting
the hair from off my brow, kissed my throbbing
temples, and bade me go to rest and
think no more of those old tales and savage
wars. And, methinks, if I could look on something
other than warrior’s harness and the
blinding glare of burnished steel, and hear
some other sound than death groans and armor
clangs, could I but lay these throbbing
temples upon the soft green turf beside my
native brook, and let my hand hang over the
bank into its blessed current, and feel the
broad sweep of its waters, while the leaves
danced over me, methinks that I could heave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
this cursed crust from off my heart and be
again a child. Yes, a child, a child! But
what have I to do with thoughts like these?
I do forget my story.</p>

<p>“That very night the Romans landed on
our shore, and the clash of steel was heard
within our quiet vale. I saw the breast that
had nourished me trampled by the iron hoof of
the war-horse; the bleeding body of my father
flung amid the blazing rafters of our dwelling.
To-day I killed a man in the arena, and when
I broke his helmet-clasps, behold! he was my
friend! He knew me,&mdash;smiled faintly,&mdash;gasped,&mdash;and
died; the same sweet smile
that I had marked upon his face when, in
adventurous boyhood, we scaled some lofty
cliff to pluck the first ripe grapes, and bear
them home in childish triumph. I told the
prætor he was my friend, noble and brave,
and I begged his body, that I might burn it
upon the funeral-pile, and mourn over his
ashes. Ay, on my knees, amid the dust and
blood of the arena, I begged that boon, while
all the Roman maids and matrons, and those
holy virgins they call vestal, and the rabble,
shouted in mockery, deeming it rare sport, forsooth,
to see Rome’s fiercest gladiator turn pale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
and tremble like a very child before that piece
of bleeding clay; but the prætor drew back as
if I were pollution, and sternly said: ’Let the
carrion rot! There are no noble men but
Romans!’ And he, deprived of funeral rites,
must wander, a hapless ghost, beside the
waters of that sluggish river, and look&mdash;and
look&mdash;and look in vain to the bright Elysian
Fields where dwell his ancestors and noble
kindred. And so must you, and so must I,
die like dogs!</p>

<p>“O Rome! Rome! thou hast been a tender
nurse to me! Ay, thou hast given to that
poor, gentle, timid shepherd-lad, who never
knew a harsher sound than a flute-note,
muscles of iron and a heart of flint; taught
him to drive the sword through rugged brass
and plaited mail, and warm it in the marrow
of his foe! to gaze into the glaring eyeballs
of the fierce Numidian lion, even as a smooth-cheeked
boy upon a laughing girl. And he
shall pay thee back till thy yellow Tiber is
red as frothing wine, and in its deepest ooze
thy lifeblood lies curdled!</p>

<p>“Ye stand here now like giants, as ye are!
The strength of brass as in your toughened
sinews; but to-morrow some Roman Adonis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
breathing sweet odors from his curly locks,
shall come, and with his lily fingers pat your
brawny shoulders, and bet his sesterces upon
your blood! Hark! Hear ye yon lion roaring
in his den? ’Tis three days since he tasted
meat; but to-morrow he shall break his fast
upon your flesh; and ye shall be a dainty meal
for him.</p>

<p>“If ye are brutes, then stand here like fat
oxen waiting for the butcher’s knife; if ye
are men, follow me! strike down yon sentinel,
and gain the mountain-passes, and there do
bloody work as did your sires at old Thermopylæ!
Is Sparta dead? Is the old Grecian
spirit frozen in your veins, that ye do crouch
and cower like base-born slaves beneath your
master’s lash? O comrades! warriors! Thracians!
if we must fight, let us fight for ourselves;
if we must slaughter, let us slaughter
our oppressors; if we must die, let us die
under the open sky, by the bright waters, in
noble, honorable battle.”</p>

<h3><a name="REGULUS_TO_THE_CARTHAGINIANS" id="REGULUS_TO_THE_CARTHAGINIANS"></a>REGULUS TO THE CARTHAGINIANS</h3>


<p>The beams of the rising sun had gilded the
lofty domes of Carthage, and given, with its
rich and mellow light, a tinge of beauty even
to the frowning ramparts of the outer harbor.
Sheltered by the verdant shores, an hundred
triremes were riding proudly at their anchors,
their brazen beaks glittering in the sun, their
streamers dancing in the morning breeze, while
many a shattered plank and timber gave evidence
of desperate conflict with the fleets of
Rome.</p>

<p>No murmur of business or of revelry arose
from the city. The artisan had forsaken his
shop, the judge his tribunal, the priest the
sanctuary, and even the stern stoic had come
forth from his retirement to mingle with the
crowd that, anxious and agitated, were rushing
toward the senate house, startled by the
report that Regulus had returned to Carthage.</p>

<p>Onward, still onward, trampling each other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
under foot, they rushed, furious with anger
and eager for revenge. Fathers were there
whose sons were groaning in Roman fetters;
maidens whose lovers, weak and wounded,
were dying in the distant dungeons of Rome;
and gray-haired men and matrons whom
Roman steel had left childless.</p>

<p>But when the stern features of Regulus were
seen, and his colossal form towering above the
ambassadors who had returned with him from
Rome; when the news passed from lip to lip
that the dreaded warrior, so far from advising
the Roman senate to consent to an exchange
of prisoners, had urged them to pursue, with
exterminating vengeance, Carthage and the
Carthaginians,&mdash;the multitude swayed to and
fro like a forest beneath a tempest, and the
rage and hate of that tumultuous throng vented
itself in groans, and curses, and yells of vengeance.
But calm, cold, and immovable as the
marble walls around him, stood Regulus the
Roman; and he stretched out his hand over
that frenzied crowd, with gesture as proudly
commanding as though he still stood at the
head of the gleaming cohorts of Rome.</p>

<p>The tumult ceased; the curse, half muttered,
died upon the lip; and so intense was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
the silence that the clanking of the brazen
manacles upon the wrists of the captive fell
sharp and full upon every ear in that vast
assembly, as he thus addressed them:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ye doubtless thought&mdash;for ye judge of
Roman virtue by your own&mdash;that I would
break my plighted oath, rather than, returning,
brook your vengeance. I might give reasons
for this, in Punic comprehension, most
foolish act of mine. I might speak of those
eternal principles which make death for one’s
country a pleasure, not a pain. But, by great
Jupiter! methinks I should debase myself to
talk of such high things to you; to you, expert
in womanly inventions; to you, well skilled
to drive a treacherous trade with simple Africans
for ivory and gold! If the bright blood
that fills my veins, transmitted free from godlike
ancestry, were like that slimy ooze which
stagnates in your arteries, I had remained at
home and broken my plighted oath to save my
life.</p>

<p>“I am a Roman citizen; therefore have I
returned, that ye might work your will upon
this mass of flesh and bones which I esteem
no higher than the rags that cover them.
Here, in your capital, do I defy you. Have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
I not conquered your armies, fired your towns,
and dragged your generals at my chariot
wheels, since first my youthful arms could
wield a spear? And do you think to see me
crouch and cower before a tamed and shattered
senate? The tearing of flesh and the
rending of sinews are but pastime compared
with the mental agony that heaves my
frame.</p>

<p>“The moon has scarce yet waned since the
proudest of Rome’s proud matrons, the mother
upon whose breast I slept, and whose fair
brow so oft had bent over me before the
noise of battle had stirred my blood, or the
fierce toil of war nerved my sinews, did with
the fondest memory of bygone hours entreat
me to remain. I have seen her, who, when
my country called me to the field, did buckle
on my harness with trembling hands, while
the tears fell thick and fast down the hard
corselet scales,&mdash;I have seen her tear her gray
locks and beat her aged breast, as on her
knees she begged me not to return to Carthage;
and all the assembled senate of Rome,
grave and reverend men, proffered the same
request. The puny torments which ye have
in store to welcome me withal shall be, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
what I have endured, even as the murmur of
a summer’s brook to the fierce roar of angry
surges on a rocky beach.</p>

<p>“Last night, as I lay fettered in my dungeon,
I heard a strange ominous sound; it seemed
like the distant march of some vast army,
their harness clanging as they marched, when
suddenly there stood by me Xanthippus, the
Spartan general, by whose aid you conquered
me, and, with a voice low as when the solemn
wind moans through the leafless forest, he
thus addressed me: ’Roman, I come to bid
thee curse, with thy dying breath, this fated
city; know that in an evil moment, the
Carthaginian generals, furious with rage that I
had conquered thee, their conqueror, did basely
murder me. And then they thought to stain
my brightest honor. But, for this foul deed,
the wrath of Jove shall rest upon them here
and hereafter.’ And then he vanished.</p>

<p>“And now, go bring your sharpest torments.
The woes I see impending over this guilty
realm shall be enough to sweeten death,
though every nerve and artery were a shooting
pang. I die! but my death shall prove a
proud triumph; and, for every drop of blood
ye from my veins do draw, your own shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
flow in rivers. Woe to thee, Carthage! Woe
to the proud city of the waters! I see thy
nobles wailing at the feet of Roman senators!
thy citizens in terror! thy ships in flames! I
hear the victorious shouts of Rome! I see
her eagles glittering on her ramparts. Proud
city, thou art doomed! The curse of Jove
is on thee&mdash;a clinging, wasting curse. It
shall not leave thy gates till hungry flames
shall lick the fretted gold from off thy proud
palaces, and every brook runs crimson to the
sea.”</p>

<h3><a name="HANNIBAL_AT_THE_ALTAR" id="HANNIBAL_AT_THE_ALTAR"></a>HANNIBAL AT THE ALTAR</h3>


<p>The last rays of the setting sun lingered on
the towers of Carthage, and tinged with a
warm flush the snowy crests of the waves that
flung their gray foam to its very ramparts.
Laughing maidens, bearing their pitchers from
the fountains, assembled at the gates; tired
camels that all day long had borne from
distant and tributary realms vestments of
purple, fragrant gums, and dust of gold,
released from their burdens, were feeding
beneath the walls; while from the deck of
many a galley the slave’s rude song floated on
the evening air.</p>

<p>In a quiet vale, secluded, yet not distant
from the city, beneath the shadow of a palm,
reclines a lovely woman; the low-voiced summer
wind, stirring the citron groves, has lulled
her to rest. The ripe grapes from a pendent
vine almost touch her swelling breast. The
spray of a neighboring fountain falls in minute
drops, like tears of pearl, on her cheek, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
a beautiful boy, tired with play, has nestled
to her side, half hidden by her flowing
locks.</p>

<p>Hurried footsteps are heard in the distance,
a heavy hand puts aside the branches, and
Hamilcar, the chieftain of the Carthaginian
armies, stands beneath the shadow of the
palm; as he bends forward to look upon his
slumbering wife, a ripe grape, shaken by the
plume of his helmet from the cluster, falls
upon the face of the sleeper, and she awakes.
Bright tears of pride and joy glitter in her
dark eyes, as, seated at his feet among the
flowers, her white arm flung in careless happiness
across his sinewy knees and throbbing
in his gauntleted grasp, she gazes on the
towering form and noble brow on which the
stern traces of recent conflict still linger.
Tempests have bronzed his cheek, desperate
and bloody conflicts left their scars upon him;
yet is he not less dear to her than when in joy
of youth they crowned the altars of the gods
with flowers, sporting among the sheaves at
harvest home. Thus she speaks:&mdash;</p>

<p>“My lord, is it disaster or business of the
State that brings you here? Your eye is
troubled, and these iron fingers too rudely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
press my flesh, as though your thoughts were
dark and fraught with doubt or danger.”</p>

<p>“I have left the camp to make good a purpose
long since known to thee, to devote with
sacred rites this boy at the altar of Mars, and
pledge him to eternal enmity with Rome.”</p>

<p>“Is this the weighty business which brings
thee at this twilight and unaccustomed hour,
thine armor soiled with dust, thy brow with
sweat, in such fierce haste to pluck this fair
child from his mother’s breast, and train him
up to slaughter? Strange that this great
empire, so full of men and arms and fleets
of war, should need the arm of childhood to
protect it. Stern man, thou lovest me not.”</p>

<p>“Why question thus my love? For as this
breastplate does my heart defend, so have I
cherished and protected thee, while in thy
fragile beauty thou hast clung around the
warrior’s stubborn strength, even as that
wreathing vine doth yonder citron clasp,
adorning its protector; but little dost thou
know, fair wife, of the affairs of nations and
of camps. Beneath these shades where the
cool zephyr from Trinacrian hills breathes
through spicy groves thou hast reposed; no
tear has stained thy cheek except the foun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>tain’s
pearly drops that glistened there when
I thy sleep disturbed.</p>

<p>“Not thus my path has lain; too well I
know the Roman’s iron strength; in times
of truce and intervals of conflict I have seen
his daily life and marked his customs well.
Poverty, at Carthage a disgrace, he but rejoices
in. The water of the brook to quench
his thirst, the dry leaves for his bed, and bread
of simplest preparation supply his wants.
Then, as the fierce she-wolf whose dugs
nourished his ancestors doth raven for her
whelps, so goes he forth to plunder and to
prey among the nations, and, for the sake of
stealing that which stolen is not worth the
keeping, will life and fortune set upon a cast.
Show to a Roman senate some patch of sand
within mid-Africa, some waste of Alpine
rocks, white with eternal snows, where,
famished peasants watch their starving flocks
and wrestle with the avalanche for life; did
Phlegethon with all his burning waves the
wretched pittance guard, and fierce Eumenides
beleaguer all the shore, yet would a
Roman consul dare the flood, do battle with
the lion for his sands, and slay the shivering
goatherd for his rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Romans turn their greedy eyes toward
these fair realms; they seek to lay in ashes
these ancestral towers, where whatsoever piety
reveres, memory recalls, or old affection cherishes,
is garnered and bestowed, nor will they
pause till every wave of this encircling sea,
crimsoned with the gore of matrons, of aged
men, and even of the laughing and unconscious
babe, shall roll its bloody burden to the shore.</p>

<p>“Most unequal is the conflict. The men
who reared these towers and moistened with
their blood these battlements are not; in their
stead has come a race of petty shopkeepers
and sycophants, having no inner life, no
haughty purpose or generous resolve, no
strength to keep what their forefathers won.
The streets are thronged with youths whose
dainty limbs are clad in flowing and embroidered
robes, whose jewelled fingers are skilful
to touch the lyre, but not to press the war-horse
through ranks of thronging spearmen,
to draw the Numidian arrow to the head,
and dip its thirsty point in hostile blood.
The rest are veterans gray with years, and
most unfit for service, like the shepherd’s
dog that, stiff with age and pampered with
good living, erects his hair and shows his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
toothless jaws, making in vain a noble front
before the gaunt and wiry wolf.</p>

<p>“Our only hope is in the legions I have
drawn from Spain, and trained in foreign
wars to conflict. But my step, once lighter
than the brindled tigers on the Libyan sands,
grows heavy with weight of years and hardships.
Were I to fall, armies would lack a
leader, my country one who loves her better
than himself, or wife, or child. But the blood
that mantles in this boy’s cheek is that of
heroes; thine ancestors and mine were chieftains
of the olden time; and when the lion
shall breed sheep will I believe that any of
our race and lineage can ever fail their country
in her hour of need. Therefore, despite
thy tears, mine own affection, and his tender
age, from off thy bosom will I take this child
and as the lion brings his whelps afield with
claws half-grown and trains them on the
hunters, so will I him. It is not what we
choose, but what our country needs, and sacred
liberty requires, that we must do, though in
the conflict our own heartstrings break. He
shall be the enemy of Rome in soul and body
and in secret thought. He shall not feed on
dainties and sleep on Tyrian purple till he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
becomes the object of men’s sneers. The panther’s
shaggy hide, the forest leaves, the dry
bed of some mountain brook, shall be his
couch, while on my corselet scales his cheek
shall rest,&mdash;the soldier’s iron pillow; and
when with growing strength and hardihood
his bones endure the harness, behind his
father’s buckler he shall learn to fight and
bathe his maiden sword in blood.”</p>

<p>At the altar of Mars, surrounded by a vast
throng of citizens, soldiery, and chief estates
of the realm, stands Hamilcar; his helmet
down conceals his features from the crowd.
On the opposite side of the altar are his wife
and her maidens; at his side the child. Placing
his little fingers on the yet quivering flesh
of the victim, he said: “Hannibal, son of
Hamilcar, swear, by this consecrated blood,
and in the presence of that dread God of battles
on whose altar it smokes, that you will
neither love nor make peace with any of
Roman blood; should fortune, friends, and
weapons fail, you will still live and die the
inexorable enemy of Rome.”</p>

<p>As he paused, the clear tones of that childish
voice, answering, “I swear,” rose upon a
stillness so deep that the low crackling of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
flames that fed the altar-fires were distinctly
audible.</p>

<p>It was broken by one wild shriek of agony,
as the frantic mother fell fainting into the
arms of her maidens.</p>

<p>The stern chieftain spake not, but, as he
stooped to raise the child, a single tear, falling
between the bars of his helmet upon the
upturned face of the wondering boy, told of
the agony within.</p>

<h3><a name="PERICLES_TO_THE_PEOPLE" id="PERICLES_TO_THE_PEOPLE"></a>PERICLES TO THE PEOPLE</h3>


<p>Imagine yourself at Athens, among that
strange people of feverish blood, who deify
to-day the man they slaughtered but yesterday.
The voice of the herald proclaims that
Pericles is to be arraigned before the tribunal
of the people. Borne along by the crowd,
you enter the hall of justice. Not a sword
rattles in its scabbard; not a mailed foot rings
on the marble floor; one deep, intense, ominous
silence pervades that dangerous assembly,
as Pericles, rising, thus addresses them:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ye men of Athens, I come not here to
plead for life, though it be spent in exile; to
entreat for a breath, though it be drawn in
the damps of a dungeon; but to refute a vile
slander; to show that he who invents and
propagates a falsehood, like Sisyphus, rolls
a stone to return and crush him. Cratinus
accuses me of having embezzled the money
raised for the defence of Greece, and of having
expended it in adorning the city of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
Athens, as a proud and vain woman decketh
herself with jewels.</p>

<p>“Have I not defended Greece, while Sparta
and the allies were reposing in comfort by
their own firesides? He avers that I was
often at the house of Phidias to admire his
statues, but insinuates that I had a softer
motive. Suppose I had; rather let him show
in what I have betrayed my country, when I
have oppressed the poor, polluted myself with
bribes, or turned back in the hour of battle.
He accuses me of sacrificing the lives of brave
men to my vaulting ambition, and even affects
to shed tears over those who fell, in the flower
of their youth, at Samos.</p>

<p>“Sacrificing! Were they machines to move
at my bidding? bullocks to be dragged up
and offered at the altar of Mars? Were they
Persian mercenaries, to be driven with whips
to the conflict? or were they patriots defending
their firesides, and I their elder brother?
They were the descendants of those who fell
at Marathon,&mdash;men whose youthful locks had
been worn off by the helmet, and whose fingers
grew to the sword-hilt.</p>

<p>“The parents of those brave men did not,
with reddening cheeks, behold them lying on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
some feverish couch, like a sick girl, crying
for cooling drinks; but they died with their
wounds in front, the broken sword in their
hand, and the shout of victory ringing in
their ears. Oh, yes! one hour of glorious
conflict&mdash;when the blood leaps and the muscles
rally for the mastery, when the hero’s
soul wings its way through gaping wounds to
Elysium&mdash;is worth a whole eternity of sitting
in senates and dull debates, and private
bickerings, and tame, common life.</p>

<p>“One day, as we were making forced marches
across the isthmus in pursuit of the Lacedæmonians,
a woman, following the camp as a
sutler, with a child at her breast, fell and
expired from fatigue. A soldier raised a
spear to despatch the infant. Moved with
compassion, I struck down his weapon; for
I thought of my own little ones at home,
whose kisses were scarcely yet cold on my
lips, and even in the confusion of pursuit, I
provided him with a nurse.</p>

<p>“On my return, he accompanied me, grew up
with my children, fed at my table, slept in my
tent, and fought behind my shield. As a
reward for life, education, and a thousand
anxious cares incurred, he has now, by false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
accusation, summoned me to the tribunal of
my country, to plead for that life which has
ever been held cheap in her service. What
shall be done with such a wretch? I hear
you exclaim: ’Send for the executioner!
burn him to ashes! fling him from the
Acropolis!’</p>

<p>“Cratinus, thou art that wretch; and yet
methinks thou hast not altogether the noble
bearing of the patriot who rejoices that he
has been able to bring to justice the betrayer
of his country; but thou hast rather the look
of some timid shepherd, who, in chasing the
stag, and pursuing the goat, has, all unwittingly,
stumbled upon the lair of the lion, and,
too terrified to flee, stands shivering before
the glaring eyeball of the tawny brute.</p>

<p>“Thou small thing, I will not hurt thee; for,
in the proud consciousness of right, I could
even pity thee. And, when again thou liest
among the slain at Megara, thy helmet cleft,
the lance of the enemy at thy throat, and
thou with not strength enough to parry it,
then call for Pericles, and he will <i>again</i> come
to thy rescue. Farewell, thou grateful child!
thou faithful friend! thou manly enemy!”</p>

<h3><a name="ICILIUS" id="ICILIUS"></a>ICILIUS</h3>


<p>The intolerable oppression of the patricians,
to which was now added the tyranny of the
Decemvirs, had excited a spirit of rancor in
the breasts of the Roman commons, which
was gradually extending itself to the entire
army that now lay encamped in a strong position
within sight of the enemy. But so sullen
was their temper that the generals feared to
lead them from their intrenchments, and the
only barrier to open mutiny seemed to be the
absence of special provocation, or the lack of
a leader.</p>

<p>Upon the slopes of Crustumeria hung the
dark masses of the Roman legions, while the
watch-fires of their enemy, gleaming through
heavy masses of foliage, lit up the vales
below. But the haughty joy with which
these stern warriors were wont to hail the
hour of conflict no longer thrilled the soldiers’
breasts. By the dim light of stars men spake
in whispers; and murmurs, waxing louder as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
the night wore on, like the hollow moan of
surf before the gathering tempest, rose on the
midnight air.</p>

<p>Just as the red light, touching, tinged the
mountain summits, a warrior, clad in gory
mantle from which the blood, slow dripping,
had stained his armor and clotted upon his
horse’s mane, rode down the sentry, and,
bursting into the midst of the camp, shouted, “Soldiers, protect a tribune of the people!”
Those pregnant words, associated with all of
liberty the commons had ever known, were
to the chafed spirits of the soldiery as fire to
flax. From every quarter of the camp trumpets
sounded to arms, the clash of steel mingled
with the tramp of hurrying feet, and,
marshalled by self-elected commanders, the
gleaming cohorts closed around him. But
when the helmet, lifted, revealed a face of
wondrous beauty, stained by the traces of
recent grief, the eyes flashing with the light
of incipient madness, and they recognized the
features of that tribune most of all beloved
by the people, tears trembled on the cheeks of
that stern soldiery, and, “Icilius!” ran in a
low wail through their ranks.</p>

<p>“Comrades,” he cried, “you behold no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
more that young Icilius who, foot to foot and
shield to shield with you, has borne the brunt
of many a bloody day, and whose life was like
a summer’s morning, rich with the fragrance
of the opening buds, while every morn gave
promise of new joys, and twilight hours were
in their lingering glories dressed,&mdash;but a man
sore broken, made ruthless by oppression, and
so beset with horrors that this reeling brain,
just tottering on the verge of madness, is
steadied only by the purpose of revenge.</p>

<p>“Yesterday, Virginia, my betrothed, was by
her father slain, to thwart the lust of Appius
Claudius, a guardian of the public virtue and
a ruler of the State.</p>

<p>“As she crosses the forum, on her way to
school, that she may take leave of her mates,
and invite them to her bridal, some ruffians set
on by Appius Claudius lay hold upon her, averring
that she is not the daughter of Virginius,
but of a slave-woman, the property of Marcus,
his client. The matter is brought to public
trial; Appius, failing to attain in this manner
the custody of her, that he may gratify his
evil passions, commands his soldiers to take
her by force. Her friends, apprehending no
violence at a legal tribunal, are without arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Soldiers are tearing her from her father’s embrace,
when the stern parent, preferring death
to dishonor, catches a knife from the butcher’s
stall, and, crying, ’Thus only can I restore
thee untainted to thine ancestors,’ stabs her
to the heart.</p>

<p>“The purple torrent gushing from her
breast, she falls upon my neck,&mdash;her arms
embrace me,&mdash;her lips close pressed to mine,
murmuring in death my name, she dies.</p>

<p>“In childhood we were lovers; from her
father’s door to mine was but a javelin’s cast.
We sought the nests of birds,&mdash;played in the
brooks,&mdash;chased butterflies&mdash;we clapped our
hands in childish wonder when the great
eagle from the Apennines plunged headlong
to the vale, or skimmed with level wing
along the flood,&mdash;and I, adventurous boy,
risked life and limb upon the jutting crag, to
pluck some wild flower that her fancy pleased.</p>

<p>“As generous wine by age becomes more
potent, thus fared it with our loves. For her
I kept myself unstained, rushed to the battle’s
front, and honors gained, that I might lay
them at her feet, and by her love inspired,
press on to worthier deeds. Like flowers
whose kindred roots intwine, whose perfume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
mingles on the morning air, did our affections
blend. ’Twas but three nights ago that we
sat hand in hand beside the Tiber, and listened
to the song of nightingales among the
elms. The purple twilight quivering through
the leaves streamed o’er her brow, and bathed
in heavenly hues her lovely form.</p>

<p>“There we talked of our approaching nuptials.
Love ripened into rapture. I kissed
her lips, and chid the slow-paced hours that
kept us from our bliss. The marriage day
was fixed. With curtains richly wrought, and
coverings of finest linen, spun by her own
hands and by her maidens’, my mother had
adorned the couch.</p>

<p>“To that sweet home where I had hoped
through happy years to cherish her a wife, I
bore her mangled corpse, gashed by her father’s
hand. Her blood bedewed the bed decked
with those nuptial gifts.</p>

<p>“To you, mates of my boyhood, brethren in
battle tried, I stretch my hands; not in the
petty interest of private wrong, but in the
sacred right of Roman liberty, of virgin
purity, sweet household joys, and in the name
of those whose fair forms mingle with your
dreams, in the fierce shock of battle nerve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
your arms, the fragrance of whose parting
kiss yet lingers on your lips.</p>

<p>“The blood of age creeps slowly, and in its
timid counsels interest and fear bear sway.
Shall youthful swords lie rusting in the scabbards,
and young men count the odds, when
slaughtered beauty from its bloody grave
clamors for vengeance?</p>

<p>“Behold this mantle, drenched in the blood
of her whose fingers wove it as a gift of love,&mdash;each
precious drop a tongue to shame your
lingering courage. Led by the father with
his bloody knife, your comrades thunder at
the gates of Rome, while you, unworthy sons
of sires who banished Tarquin and expelled
the kings, sit here deliberating whether the
virgin’s sanctity, the wife’s fair virtue, and
all that men and gods hold sacred, are worth
the striking for. Consume your youth in
hunger, cold, and vigils, with spoils of conquered
realms to pamper tyrants, till, waxing
wanton on your bounty, they desolate your
homes; and ye, hedged in by mercenary
spears, revile your misery.”</p>

<p>His words were drowned in the clash of
steel and the cries of multitudes calling to
arms. Tearing the bloody garments in pieces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
he flung them among the thronging battalions. “Be these your eagles. Bind them to
your helmets; and, in the spirit they inspire,
strike down the oppressor, that sweet Virginia’s
unquiet ghost no more may wander
shrieking for vengeance on the midnight air,
but to the silent shades appeased return.”</p>

<h3><a name="DECIUS" id="DECIUS"></a>DECIUS</h3>


<p>Patriotism in the Roman breast was something
more than principle; it was a passion.
The sacred fire, so far from being diminished
by age, waxed purer through the decay of the
flesh, and, partaking of the nature of a divine
afflatus, expired only with life itself. After
all reasonable allowances made for the enchantment
which distance flings around the
great of past ages, the instances of devotion
to country, scattered here and there through
the pages of their history, fill us with amazement.
To extend its empire, contribute to its
glory, repel its enemies, no sacrifice was
deemed too great. In common with other
ancient nations they believed that the blood
of a human victim, smoking upon the altar,
was a sacrifice most acceptable to the gods,
and in great emergencies an argument of
wondrous power. It was therefore resorted
to only when the fate of armies and nations
hung trembling in the balance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>The victims chosen were often aged, useless,
or prisoners taken in war; but when a virgin
in the purity of her innocence and the glory
of her expanding charms, or a man of noble
birth in the prime of manly vigor, with
high hopes and great inducements to live,
voluntarily devoted themselves to die for
the State, victory was considered no longer
doubtful.</p>

<p>The Roman army being engaged in desperate
conflict, and hard pressed by a valiant foe,
the left wing, under command of Decius, was
forced to retire; their general, determined to
devote himself, arrayed in a mantle broidered
with purple, and standing with bare feet upon
his spear, cried: “Ye gods and heroes who
rule over us and our enemies, and ye infernal
deities whose dwelling is in the shades beneath,
I invoke your presence. I entreat you
to give victory to the Roman armies, and
strike their enemies with fear and death. I
here devote myself to mother earth and the
shades of my ancestors in behalf of the Roman
republic, her legions and auxiliaries, and with
myself I devote the legions and auxiliaries of
the enemy. For every drop of my blood shed
in holy sacrifice grant that theirs may flow in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
torrents; for my single life, may they atone
by thousands.”</p>

<p>Putting on his armor and mounting his
horse, he said: “It is well known to you, my
countrymen, that our fathers have taught us
both by their words and acts, that it is the
duty of every citizen to devote himself to the
welfare of his country. They have taught us
during peace to cultivate the soil, to despise
luxury and effeminate pursuits, and, by begetting
and educating children, to strengthen the
State; in war by valor to defend it; nor without
sufficient reason to risk our lives, the
property of our country, bestowed by the
gods. This I have ever striven to do. I am
indeed young to die; age hath not tamed my
sinews, nor misfortune broken my spirits, that
I should be weary of life; fortune thus far
has been friendly to me, reasonable expectations
have been gratified, and efforts crowned
with success. I might justly hope for many
years of usefulness to my country and honor
to myself, but it is now in my power, by
devoting myself, to secure the interposition of
the gods in crowning with victory the banners
of our country and destroying its foes.</p>

<p>“It would be a solace to me once more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
to embrace an affectionate wife and dutiful
children, to look again upon the trees I have
planted and watched in their growth till they
have become a part of myself, and upon the
fields from which for so many years I have
raised my bread and that of my family. I
should like to walk over them once more,
but I leave them with all my other affairs to
the care of the State, which I am assured I
shall this day more benefit by death than by
the longest and most prosperous life. To you,
Valerius, I commit the care of interring my
body, that, having received the sacred rites
of burial, I may enter those happy fields,
where dwell the shades of heroes and my
warlike ancestors. I commission you to inform
my wife of the manner of my death,
charging her to educate my sons in a manner
worthy of their father and their ancestors.</p>

<p>“I pray you, my friends, look not so mournfully
upon me, as though some great misfortune
were about to befall me; for, though I
may no longer lead you to battle, my shade
will be present with you and nerve your arms
to strike for the safety and glory of the Republic.
The spirits of our ancestors hover
around us; I behold their shadowy forms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
The immortal gods are present for our aid.
Jove thunders from the sky and Apollo bends
the bow.”</p>

<p>Followed by the frantic legions assured of
victory, he rushed into the midst of the foe;
they fled in terror before the terrible warrior
armed with supernatural terrors and seeking
only death. The contest ended, the victorious
Romans drew the body of their general
from beneath a heap of slain, contemplating
with emotions of mingled pride and sorrow
the wounds which had let out a spirit so
noble. They cleansed that beloved form from
the stains of battle, arrayed it in gorgeous
robes perfumed with fragrant odors, and reverend
senators bore it to the grave.</p>

<h3><a name="LEONIDAS" id="LEONIDAS"></a>LEONIDAS</h3>


<p>It was on the morn of the 7th of August,
480 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, that Leonidas, with three hundred
kindred spirits, performed the deed that shall
be transmitted from father to son, through
the generations of men, while human hearts
shall throb with the love of country and of
the domestic hearth. Four days had the
haughty invader lingered at the mountain
pass to afford this desperate band time to
reconsider their act and disperse. Summoned
to lay down their arms, they replied, “Come
and take them.” Vainly had he poured his
thousands upon this devoted band till the
defile was choked with Persian dead. At
length the tidings came that ten thousand
men guided by a traitor were threading the
goat paths to attack their rear. With ample
opportunity to retreat, in obedience to the
laws of their country, which forbade its soldiers
to retreat from the foe, the Spartans,
dismissing their allies, remained to face the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
storm. Never before or since has law been
thus voluntarily baptized in blood, or the sun
looked down upon a scene like that.</p>

<p>On one side in solitary grandeur tower the
massive cliffs of Œta, wreathed with the white
foam of torrents, and shaggy with forests bathed
in dew; before stretches the narrow path leading
to a plain, where lie the hosts of Xerxes,
two million men; and on the other, the sea.</p>

<p>In these rude ages of brawl and battle his
life and liberty alone were safe whose hand
could help his head; thus also in respect to
communities, the nation unable to defend itself
found no allies; to be weak was to be
miserable. The institutions of Lycurgus aimed
to produce the greatest physical strength, contempt
of pain and death, and to inspire an
absorbing love of country. They decreed that
all puny and imperfect children should be put
to death, thus leaving to grow up only the
strongest of the race. All labor was performed
by slaves, that the citizens might be
left at leisure for the study and practice of
arms. The fatigues of their daily life were
greater than those of the camp, and to the
Spartan alone war afforded a relaxation.
Their cities disdained the protection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
walls, while they boasted that the women
had never seen the smoke of an enemy’s
camp. From the breast they were taught
that glory and happiness consisted in love
for their country and obedience to its laws.
They were early accustomed to cold, hunger,
and scourgings, in order to teach them endurance
and contempt of pain. No tender parent
wrought with saddened brow their battle robes,
or buckled on with tears their armor; but the
Spartan mother’s farewell to her son was, “Bring back thy shield or be borne upon it.”
Trained in the contests of the gymnasium
and the free life of the hunter and the warrior,
accustomed from childhood to the weight
of harness graduated to their growing strength,
their armor grew to their limbs, and was worn
with a grace and their weapons wielded with
a skill that was instinctive.</p>

<p>Such were the stern brotherhood, chosen
from a thousand Spartans, all the fathers of
living sons, that others might be left to fill
their places, inherit their spirit, and follow
their example. In those forms so replete
with manly beauty dwelt a spirit more noble
still, which, preferring the toils of liberty to
the ease of servitude, caught from those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
frowning precipices and that matchless sky,
ever flinging its shadow over sea and shore,
a love for the soil enduring as life itself.</p>

<p>As the sun arose they bathed their bodies
in water, anointed themselves with oil, and
arranged their hair as for a banquet. “Let
us,” said Leonidas, “breakfast heartily, for
we shall all sup with Pluto to-night.”</p>

<p>“Comrades,” cried the heroic king, as the
serried ranks gathered around him, “those
whose laws do not forbid them to retreat from
the foe have left us. I welcome you to death;
had not treachery done its work, three hundred
Spartans would have still held at bay
two million slaves. Deem not because we,
trained in all feats of arms, in the full
strength of manhood, perish nor hold the
pass, our country’s gate, we therefore die
for naught. This day shall we do more for
Sparta than could the longest life consumed
in war or councils of the State. As trees that
fall in lonely forests die but to live again, and
with other trees incorporate, lift their proud
tops to heaven, wave in the breeze, and fling
their shadows over the murmuring streams,
thus shall our blood, which ere high noon
shall smoke upon these rocks and stain these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
fretting waves, beget defenders for the soil it
consecrates. To-day you fight the battles of
a thousand years and teach this vaunting foe
that bodies are not men, that freedom’s laws
are mightier than the knotted scourge or
chains by despots forged. The savor of this
holocaust, borne by the winds and journeying
on the waves, shall nerve the patriot’s arm,
while Pinda rears its awful front, and from
its sacred caves the streams descend. Inspired
by this your act, henceforth five hundred
Spartan men shall count a thousand.
Our countrymen with envy shall view the
gaping wounds through which the hero’s soul
flees to the silent shades, and mourn they were
not privileged with us to die. Our children
shall tread with prouder step their native hills,
while men exclaim each to the other, ’Behold
the sons of sires who slumber at Thermopylæ.’
These battered arms, gathered with
jealous care, shall hallow every home; our
little ones with awful reverence shall point to
the shivered sword, the war-scarred shield,
the bloody vesture or the helmet cleft, and
say, ’My father bore these arms at old Thermopylæ.’
With noble ardor shall they yearn
for the day when their young arms shall bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
ancestral shields, the spear sustain, and, like
their sires, strike home on bloody fields for
liberty and law.”</p>

<p>Their courage needed to be attempered, not
aroused by the clangor of trumpets, the stormy
roll of drums, and the frantic shout of multitudes.
To the sound of softest music, and
decked with flowers as for a bridal, they
marched upon their foe.</p>

<p>Now flute notes and the sweet music of the
Spartan lyre floated upon the breath of morn
as they encountered the foe. Persian arrows
and javelins darkened the air, and discordant
yells rose up to heaven, but before that terrible
phalanx the multitudes went down like grass
before the scythe of the mower. Their spears
gave no second thrust, their swords no second
blow; assailed at length by millions in front
and rear, they were slain and not subdued.
Yet does their influence live in all literature
and all lands. To-day they teach the age
that there are nobler employments for man
than the acquisition of riches or the pursuit
of pleasure. The patriot scholar goes from
the contemplation of the relics of Roman and
Grecian art, to pay a deeper devotion at their
grass-grown sepulchre; listens to the dash of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
waves, breaking as they broke upon the ear
of Leonidas and his heroes, when, on that
proud morning, they marched forth to die;
reads with awe that sublime epitaph and
passes on a better patriot and a better
man.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_CENTURION" id="THE_CENTURION"></a>THE CENTURION</h3>


<p>The Roman Senate, in high conclave assembled,
deliberated respecting the raising of
fresh levies of men and arms. Powerful and
vindictive foes, with difficulty held at bay,
were gathering for attack, while the commons
were ripe for revolt. Meanwhile, a turbulent
crowd thronged the forum, surging to and
fro like forests tossed by conflicting winds.
Exasperated by oppression, beggared by usury,
they recounted their causes of discontent, and
thus fanned the smouldering flame in each
other’s breast. It was from their households
the conscription now pending was to be made;
their blood was to stain the fields of battle,
and victory, bringing but empty honors, would
leave them more under the power of their
masters than before. To increase the confusion,
some Latin horsemen came full speed
to the city, announcing that the Volsci were
on their march to attack it; upon which the
people set up a shout of joy, willing to perish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
if so be their oppressors might perish with
them.</p>

<p>Cries of agony now arose above the tumult,
and an old man pursued by creditors ran into
the midst imploring aid; but his pursuers
catching hold of the chain which was fastened
to his right foot, he fell upon his face, while
the blood gushed from his nostrils. He had
just escaped from the dungeon of a creditor;
his clothes were in tatters; his body emaciated
by hunger; while his face, hideous with
matted hair and beard, resembled more that
of a beast than of a man. Some soldiers at
length recalled the face of a centurion under
whom they had served, famed for military
skill, and distinguished by honors received as
the reward of valor in the field. It needed
but this spark to ignite a train already prepared
for explosion. With a roar, like that
of surges upon a winter’s beach, they trampled
his pursuers beneath their feet, bidding him
without fear to tell his tale, for they would
protect him though it were necessary to fling
both senate and consuls into the Tiber. And
now to that fearful uproar succeeded a silence
like that of the sepulchre, permitting the
feeble tones of the miserable man to reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
every ear and touch every heart in that vast
assembly, as thus he spake:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ten years ago, my countrymen, I was the
owner of a little farm, the fruit of my labor
and that of my ancestors. It lay along the
base of hills around whose roots wound a brook
which, watering my fields, ran into the Tiber;
on its banks grew the elms that sustained our
vines; the hills were clothed with chestnut and
olives, and there also was the pasture of my
flocks. In the sheltered vale beneath, the
almond mingled with the fig, the flax spread
its azure flowers to the sun, apples bent the
laden boughs, and grain rewarded the toil of the
reaper. How dear to me was that humble cot
with its straw-thatched roof from which the
swallows sprang to greet the breaking day;
where the stock-dove hung its nest in the
beechen shade, and morning breezes brought
perfume to its threshold. How sweet, when
the weary bullocks were released from the
yoke, to lie among the lengthening shadows
and listen to the dying breeze steal through
the soft acanthus leaves in wild, low music.
Our wants were few and easily satisfied; my
wife ground the corn, her hands spun and
wove our clothing, my children were dutiful;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
we led a frugal, happy life, revering the immortal
gods and cherishing the virtues of our
fathers. These few acres, valued as the fruit
of my own labor, the gift of my ancestors, consecrated
by their toil and pregnant with their
ashes, were to me inexpressibly dear. I, indeed,
was most of the time in arms for my country,
yet often in the midnight watches of the camp
did memory picture those sunny fields, my
family thinking and talking of the absent
soldier; nor did I forget to thank the immortal
gods, that, should my country require my
life, my family possessed a heritage and a
home. The sun was declining as I neared
my native vale on my return from the Sabine
war. Eagerly I pressed to the brow of the
hill that I might look down upon that dear
cot. It was a heap of ashes; the storm of war
had swept over those pleasant fields; fire had
consumed the standing corn; the cattle were
driven off, and the beauty of the groves had
departed. As nearer I drew, I descried the
body of my wife and first-born lying dead at
the threshold; the rest had fled, not a living
thing, even a dog, was left to welcome me;
and the tired soldier had not where to lay his
head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>“To war succeeded famine, hostilities continued,
taxes increased, the land lay untilled.
I was compelled to borrow money at exorbitant
usury; that loved heritage passed into the
hands of strangers. The golden crown and
silver chain, bestowed for being the first to
enter the enemy’s camp, went next; they are
in the coffers of a man who never saw the
color of a foeman’s eye nor drew his sword in
the State’s behalf. All this not sufficing, my
creditor immured me in a foul dungeon beneath
his palace; with fifteen pounds of iron, the
utmost the law permits, was I loaded; a pound
of corn and water was my daily food, and I,
a Roman citizen and a centurion, was scourged
like a dog. Had I not broken my chain and
flung myself upon you for protection, this war-worn
body would have been cut in pieces and
apportioned among my creditors.</p>

<p>“Comrades on many a bloody field, behold this
arm,&mdash;which in twenty-eight battles has fought
for the liberty of Rome till the hand clave to
the sword hilt,&mdash;worn by cruel fetters to the
bone; this body, seamed with honorable scars,
dripping blood from the knotted scourge.
Milder tortures would have been reserved
for me had I been the betrayer instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
the defender of my country. The laws which
consume the poor man’s substance and drain
his blood are by usurers enacted, by them are
executed. Usurers rob the public chest and
parcel out the conquered lands among themselves.
Let us, rather than longer submit to
such extortion, fling wide the gates to the
approaching enemy, leave them to exercise
their wisdom in making laws where there
are none to govern, levying taxes where there
are none to pay, and displaying their valor
where there is nought to defend. By the
ashes of that ruined home, those loved forms
mangled by the Sabine sword and devoured
by the vultures of the Apennines, by the sufferings
of my remaining children whose young
lives are consumed by the tortures from which
I have fled, by him who on Olympus holds his
awful seat and shakes the nations with his
nod, I conjure you to assert the rights of the
people and the ancient liberties of Rome.”</p>

<h3><a name="VIRGINIUS_TO_THE_ROMAN_ARMY" id="VIRGINIUS_TO_THE_ROMAN_ARMY"></a>VIRGINIUS TO THE ROMAN ARMY</h3>


<p>The night wind blew in fitful gusts, with
occasional dashes of rain, where, grouped
around their watch-fires, and sheltered by
the dense foliage of a beechen grove, a Roman
cohort held its leaguer. Some, their spears
thrust into the ground beside them, sat upright
against the trees; while others lay at
full length, with their heads resting upon
their shields.</p>

<p>As the flames threw their red light upon
the war-scarred faces of the veterans, they
revealed only sullen features. No song nor
jest was heard,&mdash;no sound, save the low hiss
of the raindrops on the embers, the bay of a
wolf in the distant forest, and the low muttered
words of a soldier who was telling to his
comrade how that, the night before, as the
sun fell over the hills, a centurion rode past
his beat full speed to Rome, summoned there
by some new outrage of the Patricians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>All that night, throughout the host, mysterious
forebodings crept. Men around their
watch-fires spake in low whispers; and many
a silent grasp of the hand passed from man to
man. As the night wore away, and the day
dawned, Virginius, upon a foaming steed, his
head bare, and in his right hand a bloody
knife, dashed past the guard to where&mdash;beneath
an oak which, withered and scorched
by sacrificial fires, flung no shadow&mdash;great
Jove was worshipped.</p>

<p>Mounting the altar-steps, he turned, and,
with bloodshot eyes, glared upon the soldiers
who thronged tumultuously around him.
Holding aloft the bloody knife, he exclaimed, “With this weapon I have slain my only
child, to preserve her from dishonor!” Yells
of horror and bitter execrations rose from the
whole army; and a thousand swords flashed
in the sun’s bright beams.</p>

<p>“Soldiers!” he cried, “I am like this
blasted tree. Two years ago the Ides of
May three lusty sons went with me to the
field. In one disastrous fight they perished.
A daughter, beautiful as the day, yet remained;
’tis but a week ago you saw her
here, bearing to her old sire home comforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
prepared by her own hands, and sharing with
him the evening meal, and you blessed her as
you passed.</p>

<p>“You’ll never see her more, who weekly
came, with the soft music of her voice, and
spells of home, to cheer our hearts. As on
her way to school she crossed the Forum,
Appius Claudius, through his minion Marcus,
claimed her as a slave. With desperate haste
I rode to Rome. Holding my daughter by
the hand, and by my side her uncle, her aged
grandsire, and Icilius her betrothed, I claimed
my child.</p>

<p>“The judge, that he may gain his end,
decides that in his house and custody she
must remain, till I, by legal process, prove my
right! The guards approach. Trembling,
she clings around my neck,&mdash;her hot tears
on my cheek. Snatching this knife from a
butcher’s stall, I plunged it in her breast, that
her pure soul might go free and unstained to
her mother and her ancestors.</p>

<p>“And this is the reward a grateful country
gives her soldiery! Cursed be the day my
mother bore me! Accursed my sire’s untimely
joy! Accursed the twilight hour,
when ’mid Etruscan groves I wooed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
won Acestes’ beauteous child, while youth’s
bright dreams were busy at my heart!</p>

<p>“Soldiers! the deadliest foes of our liberties
are behind, not before us; they are not
the Æqui, the Volsci, and the Sabines, who
meet us in fair fight; but that pampered
aristocracy, who chain you by the death-penalty
to the camp, that in your absence
they may work their will upon those you
leave behind.</p>

<p>“But why do I seek to kindle a fire in ice?
Why seek to arouse the vengeance of those
who care for no miseries but their own, and
are enamoured of their fetters? I, indeed,
can lose no more. Misfortune hath emptied
her quiver,&mdash;she hath no other shaft for this
bleeding breast; but flatter not yourselves
that the lust of Appius Claudius has expired
with the defeat of his purpose.</p>

<p>“Your homes, likewise, invite the destroyer;
into your fold the grim wolf will leap; among
the lambs of your flock will he revel, his jaws
dripping blood. For you, also, the bow is
bent; the arrow drawn to the head; and the
string impatient of its charge. By all that I
have lost, and that you imperil by delay,
avenge this accursed wrong!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you have arms, use them; liberties,
vindicate them; patriotism, save the tottering
State; natural affection, protect the domestic
hearth; piety, appease the wrath of the gods
by avenging the blood that cries to heaven.
To arms! To arms! or your swords will
leap from their scabbards, the trumpets sound
the onset, and the standards of <i>themselves</i>
advance to rebuke your delay!”</p>

<h3><a name="GENERAL_GAGE_AND_THE_BOSTON" id="GENERAL_GAGE_AND_THE_BOSTON"></a>GENERAL GAGE AND THE BOSTON
BOYS</h3>


<p>The year seventeen hundred and seventy-five
dawned gloomily upon the inhabitants of
Massachusetts Bay. Portentous clouds darkened
the political horizon, while clear-sighted
and forecasting men prepared themselves for
a struggle they saw to be inevitable. The
attempt to crush by force of arms the spirit
of liberty in the colonies had already commenced.
A hostile fleet, with guns double-shotted
and trained upon the town, lay at
anchor in Boston Harbor. The town was
under martial law, the hills bristled with
cannon, sentinels challenged the citizen going
to his daily vocations, and the common was
a camp.</p>

<p>On the wharves of this busy emporium of
colonial trade that had been wont to send its
thousand vessels each year to foreign and
domestic ports, the sailor’s song was hushed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
warehouses were closed, and no canvas fluttered
to the breeze. But few shops, and those
only which dealt in the necessaries of life, were
opened, and the hammer of the artisan lay
rusting on the anvil. In many streets the
snow lying white and undisturbed before the
doors of hospitable dwellings evinced that
their occupants had fled from a tyranny
they were unable to resist. Beneath this
grinding oppression, so intolerable to the
spirit of a free people, no weak complaints
were uttered nor sounds of riot heard. The
citizen pursuing his business brushed the
sentinel with a calm brow and sealed lips,
and the children went to and fro to their
schools and plays.</p>

<p>When soldiers barracked and horses were
stabled in their churches, when bayonets
gleamed in their halls of legislation, they
lifted up the voice to God in other places and
the town meeting was held as heretofore.
For the first time in the history of peoples,
the flocks sported in the pasture or slept
in the fold unconscious of the butcher’s knife;
the inhabitants of Massachusetts had resolved
to eat no mutton, that their resources might
be increased. On the roofs of sheds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
porticoes wool and flax were bleaching; from
hundreds of dwellings were heard the hum of
the wheel and the stroke of the loom, where
the mothers of heroes were preparing their
children for the forum or the field. Balls
were run and cartridges made by the hands
of women and children at the kitchen fire,
and, deftly concealed in loads of offal, passed
unchallenged the sentries to hiding-places in
the neighboring towns. Men who pursued
their usual labors during the day met at midnight
in garrets and cellars, and after swearing
upon the Scriptures to keep secret the purpose
of the meeting, consulted and prayed
together, enduring meanwhile as best they
might the insults of the soldiery.</p>

<p>It was Wednesday afternoon and half-holiday.
General Gage, commander of troops
that held watch and ward over the rebels in
Massachusetts Bay and the town of Boston in
particular, was sitting in his quarters at the
Province House. The general’s brow was
clouded and he was evidently a prey to uneasy
thoughts; the intelligent perversity of
his opponents both perplexed and alarmed
him. He liked not the unwonted calm, the
utter absence of bluster and bravado, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
knew too well the temper of the people with
whom he had to deal to mistake silence for
submission. He had fought with Washington
at Duquesne, aided to bear the dying Braddock
from the field, and feared that the rifles
that then saved the British army from utter
destruction were only biding their time, and
the drums that beat at Louisburg might at
any moment wake the slumbering fires and
the mine explode beneath his feet.</p>

<p>While thus uneasily balancing probabilities,
his servant announced that some boys requested
an interview. The general, who was
exceedingly fond of children, ordered them to
be admitted.</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” he inquired, “what is your
business with me?”</p>

<p>“We have come, sir,” said the tallest boy, “to demand satisfaction.”</p>

<p>“What, have your fathers been teaching
you rebellion and sent you to show it
here?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, nobody sent us and nobody told
us to come, but we’ve come of our own accord
for our rights. The common belongs to the
people of Boston and their children. We are
town born, all of us, and so are the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
whom we represent, therefore we have a right
to play on the common. We have asked
many old people, and they tell us that boys
always have had this right, that they played
there and their fathers before them. We
have never made faces at your soldiers, called
them lobsters, thrown snowballs at them, or
insulted them in any manner, but while we
were minding our business, skating and building
snow hills, just as we have always done
every winter before even they were here, they
came and trampled down our sliding hills, and
broke the ice on our skating ground with the
breech of their musket. We complained;
they called us young rebels and told us to
help ourselves if we could. We then went to
the captain, and he laughed at us. We have
come, sir, for our rights. We want only the
rights which the law gives us and boys have
always had. Yesterday your soldiers destroyed
our works for the third time, and we
won’t endure this oppression any longer.
Your soldiers may shoot us if they wish, but
if you will not give us satisfaction, we will
get together all the boys and defend our works
while there is a snowball, a stone, or a boy
left in the town of Boston; for if we can’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
play on our own common and skate on our
own pond, what can we do?”</p>

<p>The general could not but admire the
resolution of the boys and assured them that
henceforth their rights should be respected.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_WRECKED_PIRATE" id="THE_WRECKED_PIRATE"></a>THE WRECKED PIRATE</h3>


<p>In the year 1813 a piratical schooner was
wrecked upon one of the desolate Keys of the
Bahamas. The captain alone, of a crew of
ninety men, reached shore upon a broken
spar. For several months he subsisted upon
shell-fish and tropical fruits, with which the
island abounded, eked out by some provisions
saved from the wreck.</p>

<p>While in this solitude, feelings which had
long slumbered were awakened in his breast,
and his heart was melted to repentance.</p>

<p>After long months of waiting, he was rescued
by a passing vessel bound for Spain. A
pardon was at length obtained for him from
the Spanish government, and he ever after
lived a Christian life. But what thus wrought
upon the heart of the savage, hardened in
crime and blood? “Fear,” I hear you exclaim, “heightened by that terrible solitude;
death groans and piteous entreaties for mercy
that haunted each lonely ravine, and moaned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
in the winds of midnight!” Oh, no; it was
but the evening song of the turtle-doves which
built their nests among the mangrove bushes
that fringed the borders of the creeks.</p>

<p>Behold him as he stands! that man of
brawl and battle, his stern features unmoved
as the cliffs beside him, gazing upon the bodies
of the companions of many a bloody fray,
tossed amid the fragments of broken timbers
in the surf at his feet. What a mingling of
the elements of agony and fear!&mdash;the abyss of
ocean, the lonely wreck, the livid bodies of the
dead, the desolate shore, himself cut off from
all human fellowship, a stinging conscience
within, and the eternal God above him, whose
lightnings play around his head. All these
move him not. But hark! As those bird-notes,
so sweetly mournful, strike upon his
ear, familiar through many an hour of careless
boyhood in his early home, the blood
flushes to his cheek and lip; the sweat bedews
his brow. Those soft notes recall days of innocence,
ere blood had stained his hand, and
remorse was gnawing at his heartstrings.
The low notes of a mother’s prayer thrill, like
some forgotten melody, upon his ear. Again
her lips are pressed to his as when she kissed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
him for the last time, upon his father’s threshold.
Tears are streaming down those cheeks,
bronzed by burning suns and furrowed by seafoam
and tempest; and that voice, whose stern
tones had risen above the roar of battle and
roused the seaman from his slumbers like the
trump of doom, grows all tremulous with emotion
as he cries, “God, be merciful to me a
sinner.”</p>

<p class="center"><small>[Delivered at a meeting of the Temperance Society in
Boston in 1861]</small></p>


<p>Were I called upon, Mr. Chairman, to define
intemperance by its effects, I would say: “It
is that which covers the fields of the husbandman
with tares and thorns, and strews the
ocean with wrecks. It is that which renders
the clerk unfaithful to his employer, the public
man to his constituents, the magistrate to his
oath of office, the parent to his family, and all
who are trusted to every trust. It is that which
stirs to mutiny every corrupt passion, weakens
every motive to virtue, adds strength to
vicious allurements, and pushes the reluctant
will over the verge of every damnable and desperate
enterprise. So well is this understood
by the doers of evil that it is in the armies of
evil the regular weapon whose value is unquestioned
after the experience of ages. Is
a seaman to be enticed to desert his ship or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
soldier his colors? Ply him with liquor. Is
a ruffian steeped in crime to be urged to some
deed of horror from which even his hardened
nature revolts? Ply him with liquor. Is a
young man with his curiosity awake, his passions
pure and jubilant, and his heart throbbing
with warm impulses of budding life to be
put upon that same descending grade opening
to a like abyss of utter loathsomeness, his fair
face to be rendered shameless, and his lips to
reek of the pit? Then go, thou familiar
spirit, whose abode is in the sparkling cup,
assume the form of beauty and youth, show
him not at once thy craven features, but
while his arm is linked in thine, accustom
him by slow gradations to the festive and
genial cup.”</p>

<p>The ways and methods of doing good are
not intuitive. They are, as in the arts and
crafts, the result of effort and experience.
Good men by long practice into which they
have flung their very hearts have learned
more and more effective methods of grappling
with intemperance. At first they began with
cure; now they try prevention, not forgetting
the other. Once they went alongside the old
hulk stranded on the beach, her masts gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
by the board, her rigging white and weather-worn
hanging over her bulwarks, ochre hanging
from her opening seams, and refitting
and relaunching her, they obtained from the
stranded hulk a few years of inferior service.
Now they buoy the channel and light the
beacon, and thus prevent the shipwreck.
Noble men went to the inebriate crawling in
the gutter; with kindly sympathy they raised
him up and restored him to usefulness and
power. But who, save the inebriate himself,
can tell the bitterness of that struggle between
the man, the husband, the father, struggling
to rise, and the demon that strives to drag
him back? How true it is that that accursed
longing never dies! How true it is that we
need never learn to drink but once! What
temperance reformer is there who has not
shed bitter tears over the final wreck of those
whom he thought he had saved?</p>

<p>Thus noble efforts were made, multitudes
partially, and many really reformed, but all
the time behind there was a thronging army
of young men treading the same paths. But,
taught by experience, men have now begun
to grapple with this evil on its strongest
ground; that is, in its social aspect, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
which is most alluring to the romantic and
the young.</p>

<p>I may safely say that from the beginning
of social life the great mass of the literature,
genius, and wealth of the world has been,
and is now, on the side of intemperance. The
greatest poets that ever lived have sung in
strains of beauty that captivated the young
heart the praises of the ruby wine. It has
for ages been interwoven with all festivals,&mdash;the
meeting and parting of social life.
It is this more than the love of liquor that
attracts. In this view wine becomes the
exponent of all that is genial and warm;
temperance of all that is cold, forbidding, and
repulsive. It is for just this purpose and to
meet the enemy at just this point that associations
like this have been formed. They seek
to show that the flowing bowl is not of necessity
the quickener of the intellect, or of all
ardent and generous feeling; that it is not
the only elixir for the heavy heart. They
would show that there are other pleasures as
exhilarating as those of the wine cup&mdash;pleasures
that leave no sting behind. They would
show that men can be earnest scholars,
sympathetic friends, jovial companions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
at the same time taste not, touch not, and
handle not the wine cup, or be under any
obligations to alcohol for their enjoyment.
May this association in the heart of this great
city accomplish its purpose, and be the young
man’s friend.</p>

<h3><a name="RELIGIOUS_WORSHIP_EARLY_IN_THE" id="RELIGIOUS_WORSHIP_EARLY_IN_THE"></a>RELIGIOUS WORSHIP EARLY IN THE
CENTURY</h3>

<p><small>[Delivered at the Municipal Celebration of the one hundredth
anniversary of the incorporation of the town of
Portland, Maine, Sunday, July 4, 1886.]</small></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chairman</span>: Having been requested to
offer some remarks in respect to the conduct
of religious worship early in the century, I
would say that early impressions are the most
enduring, and religious impressions more so
than all others, resulting from the fact that
they are not so much impressions as the development
of innate tendencies kept alive and
nourished by the intercourse that all men, to a
greater or less extent, hold with their Creator.
There are none that so resent interference or
are with such difficulty eradicated. Though
by no means one of the good boys who die
young, and with little inclination to acquire
knowledge by books or by dint of study,
there were two subjects that always possessed
for me a peculiar interest and attraction&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
one the employment by which men obtained
their bread, and the other the discussion of
religious doctrines, though utterly averse to
any personal application of them. I recollect
that when I had twenty-five cents given me
by my father to go to Sukey Baker’s tavern
to see an elephant, a rare sight in those days,
I sat as demure as a mouse in my father’s
study the greater part of an afternoon listening
to a discussion between him and a Hopkinsonian
minister upon disinterested benevolence,
which was brought at last to an abrupt termination
in consequence of the use by the
Hopkinsonian of the following illustration: “Suppose, Brother Kellogg, I was walking
over a bridge with two ladies, to one of whom
I was tenderly attached and engaged to be
married, the other an indifferent person. My
particular friend, I am aware, is a person of
ordinary ability, but the other lady is possessed
of great mental powers thoroughly disciplined,
and both of them are in a state of grace. The
bridge breaks through and we fall into the
stream. I can save but one of them, and in
that case it would be my duty, even if I had
to leave my personal friend to perish, to save
the more gifted person, because she is able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
and qualified to do more for the glory of
God.” My father ended the discussion by
rising and declaring that a man who could
cherish, much more propagate, such abominable
sentiments was not fit to preach the
Gospel nor even to live in a Christian society.
The discussion and ways of ministers, their
preaching and modes of conducting worship at
that period are as vivid in my recollection
to-day as then, and I purpose to turn this to
account in complying with your request.</p>

<p>Religious worship at that time, though
modified, still retained much of the ancient
spirit and something of the form. My father
and the ministers of his age formed the connecting
link between the old and the new.
Many of the old ministers, who were settled for
life, and wore old ministerial wigs, cocked
hats, small clothes, and bands, were still preaching,
and frequently exchanged with my father,&mdash;Father
Lancaster of Scarborough, Mr. Tilton
and Mr. Eaton of Harpswell. Father Lancaster
would sometimes fall asleep in the pulpit
while the choir were singing the hymn
before the sermon, for he was well-stricken
with years. Ministers of a later date wore a
queue and powdered their hair. My father in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
younger life wore his hair long, and it curled
down his back and was powdered. He also
retained the bands for a neck dress. I can
just recollect when he exchanged breeches for
loose pants. The old people, who were opposed
to the innovation, called them sailor trousers,
and said they did not become a servant of
God, were got up to conceal spindle shanks,
and the deacons of the First Parish and some
others retained them. The sermons and
prayers were somewhat curtailed, even by the
old ministers, but were still of sufficient length.
The hour-glass was no longer seen on the pulpit,
but was still used in families, schools, and
by the toll-keeper at Vaughan’s bridge. The
deacons in the First Parish still sat before the
pulpit, but the practice of deaconing the hymns
was given up. Intentions of marriage were
no longer cried in the church with the addition
that if any person could show cause why they
should not be carried into effect, to make it
known, or else forever to hold their peace;
but publishments were posted in the porch of
the meeting-house for all to read. Much importance
was attached to the singing, and it
was always performed by a full choir, as loud
noise was by our forefathers deemed essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
in public worship. At first there was no instrument
except the bass viol. The chorister,
conscious of the dignity of his office, would
rise with a solemn air, run up the scale, beating
time with his hand, and lift the tune. My
father, who had been drum-major in the Continental
army, and was extremely fond of instrumental
music, introduced the cornet and
clarinet, in addition to the bass viol, into the
Second Parish choir. He likewise persuaded
Mr. Edward Howe, of Groton, Massachusetts,
to come and set up business in Portland on account
of his musical talent, and assisted him
all he could, and Mr. Howe led the choir of the
Second Parish for years, keeping up with the
progress of the times. Difficulties with church
choirs were as prevalent then as now. At one
time the first hymn was read, but there was
no response from the choir. My father, who
was a good singer, immediately read the hymn, “Let those refuse to sing who never knew our
God,” and led off himself, and the congregation
joined in. When the next hymn was read, the
choir concluded to sing.</p>

<p>There was no fire in the meeting-houses.
The women carried foot-stoves that contained
an iron dish filled with hot coals. The sexton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
was bound by written contract to keep a good
rock-maple wood fire on the Sabbath in order
that the people might have good coals with
which to fill their foot-stoves in the morning
and replenish them between meetings. Children
suffered the most from cold feet, and
would often cry with cold. I used to run my
legs to the knees into my mother’s muff and get
my feet on her foot-stove and long for services
to be done. My father used to say that when
he could hear people all over the house striking
their feet together to quicken the circulation,
he felt it was time to stop preaching, and
indeed he seldom preached more than forty
minutes, and often less. But many of the old
ministers who exchanged with him had a
method of dividing their sermons that to a boy
with cold feet was extremely tantalizing. They
would have six, eight, and often ten heads of
discourse after which came “the improvement,”
the most excruciating of all. After a long
time occupied in the application of what had
preceded, the minister would say “lastly.”
Then all the younger portion of the audience
would prick up their ears and handle their
mittens in expectation of the close, but after
this would come “finally,” and on the heels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
of “finally” “to conclude,” and after “conclude,” “in short.” There were few Sabbath-schools;
religious instruction was in former
days given to the children by means of the
Westminster Catechism that was taught to
children by their parents; and at stated times
in the year the ministers were accustomed to
assemble all the children of the parish and
catechise them. Parents who were not religious,
equally with others, taught their children
the catechism that they might be able to
answer the questions of the ministers and appear
as well as their companions. This method
of instruction had fallen in a measure into
disuse, and though Sabbath-schools had been
substituted to take its place, they were not
cherished or conducted as at present. No
pains were taken to render them attractive.
Some parents held on to both methods of religious
instruction upon the principle that there
never could be too much of a good thing. The
schools had little hold upon the hearts of the
ministers of the church and were generally
taught outside. The first Sabbath-school I
attended was held in a schoolhouse that stood
on the northeastern side of State Street. The
late Mr. Cahoon was my teacher. The New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Testament was the text-book. Children committed
hymns but took no part in the singing.</p>

<p>There was a vein of austerity running
through the relations that existed between
parents and children. They were neither
fondled nor pampered, but taught self-denial,
to obey their parents, and reverence old age.
In many families the children ate at a side
table, as they were not supposed to be fitted
by age or development to associate with their
elders.</p>

<p>In the province of labor there was no special
adaptation of the implements of labor to
the physical strength of children, nor in matters
of education any adaptation of studies or
methods of teaching to their mental wants as
at present, but children and youths used to a
large extent the tools and books of their elders
or waited till they grew up to them. Thus,
in matters of religion, immediate effect was
not expected either in relation to children or
adults. It was not expected that a person
would be converted till he was married and
settled in life.</p>

<p>The question will naturally arise in the
minds of many, what was the result of such
a mode and spirit of worship as to the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>motion
of vital godliness and the conversion
of souls. I reply, there was but little fruit.
The preaching was mostly argumentative and
controversial or political&mdash;the conic sections
of godliness. Ministers seemed to feel that
their responsibility ended when they had faithfully
preached the truth and kept back nothing,
and church members, when they attended
the ordinances and kept the faith.</p>

<p>The first great change for the better in this
state of affairs was caused by the embargo,
which crushed for a season and well-nigh exterminated
the business interests of Portland.
It brought those who had become giddy with
more than twenty years of unexampled prosperity
to reflection. In proportion as their
prospects in this life were blighted, they directed
their attention to the attainment of more durable
riches. The ministers of the gospel of all
denominations took advantage of the changed
condition of thought, and there was a great
revival of religious interest throughout New
England. Edward Payson, who was then in
the prime of life and a colleague with my
father, exerted himself to an extent that consigned
him to an early grave, and there was
during his ministry a constant revival. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>stead
of fate, free-will, foreknowledge, absolute
free-will, etc., people began to hear of Christ
and Him crucified, the still small voice of the
Spirit, and the danger of delay. The eyes of
men, stirred to a new life, were now opened to
perceive the great obstacles to the progress of
religion and morality.</p>

<p>The drinking customs of the day which had
now reached a fearful extent, and African slavery
and the discussions concerning it, caused
a shaking of the dry bones seldom equalled;
for conscience, self-interest, and the law of
God were pitted against each other. The
main shaft that carried the wheels of business
in Portland was the lumber trade, which consisted
in transporting lumber to the West
Indies and bartering it for molasses, a large
portion of which was made into rum that
went all over the country. There was new
rum for poor people, and West India rum for
those in better circumstances. I have seen
my mother, as often as Parson Lancaster exchanged
with my father, mix Holland gin and
loaf sugar and warm it for him before he
went into the pulpit and after he came out.
I once went with my father to a funeral in
Beaver (now Brown) Street, and a decanter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
of liquor and glasses were set on the coffin.
At eleven o’clock on each day the bell would
ring, the masons come down from the ladders,
the joiners drop their tools, and all would partake
of rum, salt-fish, and crackers. This
great obstacle, in a measure taken out of the
way, led to the development of a spirit of
Christian enterprise which I leave to abler
tongues and pens to describe.</p>

JUNE 25, 1890</h3>


<p>[Among papers especially treasured by Mr.

<div class="small">
<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Brunswick, Maine</span>, May 22, 1890.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Kellogg</span>: The coming Commencement
will be the fiftieth anniversary of your graduation. It is
our custom to call first on a representative of the class of
fifty years ago; and as goes his speech, so goes the dinner.
Now you are not only the natural representative of the class
of fifty years ago, but one of the most widely known and universally
beloved of all the graduates of our whole hundred
years. So we shall look to you for the response from the
Class of ’40. You must not fail us. If you do not report
yourself present at the formation of the procession in the
morning, we shall send a sheriff and posse after you. The
Congressmen will not be here this year. The success of the
dinner depends on your coming, and giving us such a send-off
as you only can give to a crowd of Bowdoin College boys.
It will be a sad day for Bowdoin College if there shall ever
be a generation of students who know not Elijah Kellogg.</p>

of the Alumni, and Classmates</span>: It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
fifty years this autumn since I presented myself,
a sedate and diffident youth, between the
two maple trees that relieved the monotony
of this then arid and barren college yard, and,
like friendship and misfortune, flung their
shadows over the steps of Massachusetts
Hall, and sued for admittance to Bowdoin
College. With that humility which was an
inherent attribute of youth in that bygone
day, I requested an inhabitant of this village
to point out to me the president of
the college, and I gazed upon the great
man with that anxiety and solicitude, inspired
by the belief that my fate and that of my
companions lay in his clutches. Since that
period, since that comparatively short period,
what changes have taken place! This barren
college yard, across which students were wont
to hurry, has been transformed into a beautiful
and attractive campus where they are now
prone to linger and repose and sport. This
then barren college yard, where Professors
Smyth and Newman struggled desperately to
prolong the existence of a few sickly trees,
and died in the struggle, is now adorned
by that beautiful Memorial Hall, created by
the hands of a progressive age, and transmit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>ting
to other generations the virtues and the
memory of those sons of Bowdoin who were
true to their country in the hour of her peril.</p>

<img src="images/p288.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Elijah Kellogg at Seventy-seven.</span><br />1890.</div>
</div>


<p>But in other respects what changes!
Every president but two, a great portion of
the overseers, the trustees, and alumni, every
instructor, every teacher, every tutor, almost
every person in any way connected with this
college, from the treasurer to the janitor, and
the woman who took care of the rooms, have
all passed away. I can reckon my own surviving
classmates on my fingers, and I stand
here to-day like an old tree among the
younger growth, from whose trunk the bark
and leaves have fallen, and whose roots are
drying in the soil. Then I could stand where
the roads divide that lead to Mere Point and
Maquoit, and hear the roar of the Atlantic in
one ear and that of the falls of the Androscoggin
in the other. To-day I have not heard
a word, except the two words “Bowdoin
College.”</p>

<p>But there is no decrepitude of the spirit.
Moons may wax and wane, flowers may
bloom and wither, but the associations that
link the student to his intellectual birthplace
are eternal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>There is an original tendency in the human
mind which is the foundation of the desire for
property. We all naturally crave something
that is our own. What lover of nature wants
to be where everybody has been? It is an
instinctive tendency. We want our own land,
however limited; our own house, however
humble; our own books, however few in number.
Who, I pray you, wants to “wear his
heart upon his sleeve for daws to peck at,”
or be a member of a fraternity that is like
an unfenced common for every slimy thing to
creep and to crawl over? It is this instinctive
feeling which has from the beginning
been at the foundation of all fraternities of
every description, and they have striven to
realize this idea, though they have not always
accomplished it. This principle of limitation
strengthens by concentrating every association
and every feeling of the human mind,
just as the expansive gases derive their terrific
power from compression, and liquids, by
concentration, gain in pungency what they
lose in bulk. It is this which imparts such
magic power to the college tie, because the
college tie brings and binds together, at a
period when friendships are most ardent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
sincere, and feelings are most plastic, those
who have separated themselves to intermeddle
with all knowledge, and unites them in the
pursuit of all that can honor God, develop the
intellect, or benefit mankind.</p>

<p>It introduces them at once into a fraternity
composed, not merely of their own classmates
and contemporaries, but of all the gifted and
the good who still live in their works, and by
whose labors they profit. The longer a man
lives, the broader his views, and the more he
experiences of men and things, the more he
feels his obligation to his Alma Mater, to the
nourishment he drew from her bosom, to the
formative influences with which she surrounded
him. Brethren, it was here we were intellectually
born and bred.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">“’Twas here our life of life began,</div>
    <div class="verse">The spirit felt its dormant power.</div>
    <div class="verse">’Twas here the youth became the man,</div>
    <div class="verse">The bud became the flower.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The longer a man lives the more sensible
he becomes of this obligation, and though it is
impossible to repress a feeling of sadness when
we visit the rooms and tread the floors where
those swift-winged hours flew, and where we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
decipher the almost obliterated inscriptions,
the names on the walls, names of those most
dear to us, of those whose step kept time and
whose hearts throbbed in unison with ours,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">“Who the same pang and pleasure felt,</div>

    <div class="verse">Of those cold fetters fashioned by</div>
    <div class="verse">That wayward king, society.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And yet these considerations are modified
by the reflection that they have nobly used
the training that they here received, and are
exerting influences that survive them, and
have sown seed that shall be the increment
of future harvests.</p>

<p>I feel grateful that a lengthened life and
an intimate acquaintance with the history and
former faculty and the students of this college
have enabled me to appreciate the progress
of this institution for the last fifty years.
For more than forty years circumstances have
so ordered it that I have been brought into
most intimate relations with the faculty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
students of Bowdoin College. They have
loved me and I have loved them. I have
been brought into contact with these young
men at a period in their moral and mental
development when a youth will tell his whole
heart, all his best plans, aspirations, and difficulties
to an older person who he feels understands
him and whom he knows he can trust;
and in the light of this experience, I do not
hesitate to say that this college never stood
so high in moral and intellectual work as it
does this day. In 1838 I listened to the
farewell address of President Allen to the
faculty and students of this college and
the inhabitants of this town, in which he
declared that this college was a seething tub
of iniquity, and he could not in conscience
advise any parent to send a child here. Mr.
President, do you think you could in conscience
make such a declaration? And whatever
may be thought, I say whatever may
be thought of the good judgment of the
reverend gentleman, it cannot be denied that
he had good grounds for his assertion.</p>

<p>There were at that time a great many pious
and devoted students in college, as many,
probably, in proportion to the number, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
have ever been since. They had a praying
circle, and the college church kept up their religious
meetings and attended them promptly.
They lived, the greater portion of them, devoted
and consistent lives, and from time to
time they received the influence of the Divine
Spirit, and many strong men were brought to
Christ and fitted for usefulness; but in general
they had the fire all to themselves and it
warmed no one else. The good went with the
good, and the bad with the bad. There was
a line of demarcation between them. I did
what I could to break it, came very near shipwreck,
and shall carry the scars of it to my
grave, but I am glad I made the attempt.
Those were not the methods which the changing
times required. The Christian Association
which has superseded them, built on a
broader basis, meets the requirements of to-day,
and does more to promote the morality
of the college. Things have broadened since
I was a boy. Why, when I was a young man,
it was thought that a person couldn’t be converted
till he was married and settled in life.</p>

<p>Another thing which has added strength to
this college and been fruitful in respect to
morality is the attention that has been paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
of late to athletic exercises. This outlet for
superfluous energy has more to do with the
good order and subordination of the institution
than most people are wont to imagine.
Boys that in my day would have been playing
cards in their room for a hot supper and fixings
at the Tontine, are now pulling an oar
or playing baseball or lawn-tennis, and the
germs of mischief ooze out in copious drops
of perspiration. And when night comes,
instead of reveling in shirt-tail processions,
making night hideous, they are contented to
sit down with their books or go to bed.</p>

<p>It has always been a vexed problem how to
give students exercise. Every man of common
sense knows that students, in order to
accomplish anything, must have exercise.
Andover built a large building, bought tools
and stock, hired a skilled foreman, and was
going to set the students to work. They
wasted so much lumber and brought the
institution so heavily in debt that they were
obliged to sell out and turn the building into
a house for Professor Stone.</p>

<p>I recall the military drill here. It was all
very well for a while. But all couldn’t be
officers. Nobody was content to be dragooned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
by an army officer. But lawn-tennis, baseball,
football, and the gymnasium fill the bill.
The students are proud of their gymnasium,
and I know from personal experience that,
during the last eight years, those who have
excelled in athletic exercises have also excelled
in rank.</p>

<p>Now I believe that this college has taken a
new departure, and I believe there is a future
for it from the fact that the alumni take more
interest in the college than they used to take,
and because there are so many poor students
connected with it. Poor students are the salvation
of a college. I know young men who
worked their way through college who are
to-day its benefactors. I worked my way
through college with a narrow axe, and when
I was hard up for money, I used to set the
college fence afire and burn it up, and the
treasurer would hire me to build another
one. Let the young man who has to help
himself thank God, keep his powder dry, and
take to his bosom the old motto: “<i>Per
angusta ad augusta.</i>”</p>

<h3><a name="AT_CENTENNIAL_CELEBRATION_OF" id="AT_CENTENNIAL_CELEBRATION_OF"></a>AT CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF
BOWDOIN COLLEGE, JUNE 28, 1894</h3>


<p>My love, Mr. President, for this college was
inherited. I drew it in with my mother’s
milk, and was taught it at my father’s knees.
He was one of its first trustees, proposed its
first president, and sold the lands the proceeds
of which, after almost interminable delays,
built Massachusetts Hall. Judge Freeman of
the trustees, a most excellent and influential
man and ardently attached to the college, was
naturally very cautious, and that trait was now
much increased by age; it seemed on account
of his influence as if a building would never
be erected. It was at length moved at a
meeting of the Boards that my father be
appointed and empowered to sell the college
lands. He accepted the trust on condition
that they would put Judge Parker of Massachusetts
with him to draw the writings. This
being done, he said, “Gentleman, these lands
will all be sold within a year.” Judge Free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>man,
stroking his face, as was his habit when
excited, exclaimed: “They will ruin us. They
will ruin us.” “I,” observed another of the
trustees, “want to be ruined; I had rather die
at once than moulder away by dry rot.” The
lands were sold within the specified time, a
building was then erected, and President
McKeen inaugurated. Seldom has the hand
of Divine Providence been more clearly manifested
than in the origin and growth of this
college. From its inception it secured in its
presidents, professors, trustees, and overseers
men who had the interests of morality and
sound learning more at heart than their own
ease or emolument. The abilities of its teachers
and their reputation would have at any
time procured for them more eligible positions
if ease, compensation, and reputation had alone
been consulted. They were self-denying men;
they loved the college and labored and denied
themselves for its good.</p>

<p>I was absent from college but three years
when I returned and settled at Harpswell. I
had a great deal to do with the college, was
in intimate relations with the professors and
their families, and had opportunity to appreciate
their real worth. They were not merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
residents of the community, but useful citizens
and a public blessing. The high school owes its
origin in a great degree to Professor Smyth.
All the neighboring ministers were under more
or less obligation to them. They attended
funerals, supplied destitute churches, and in
the weekly religious meetings of the village
were a power for good. I have worked weeks
with Professor Smyth, setting out trees on the
campus which he bought and paid for. Professor
Upham gave the greater part of his
property to the college. He for two years
supplied the pulpit of the Congregational
church at Harpswell, and but for his efforts
it would not have been in existence now. In
the last term of my senior year he came to
Andover and told me if I did not go to
Harpswell, God would curse me as long as I
lived. I do not know what the Lord would
have done, but I have found that obedience is
sweet and not servitude.</p>

<p>Those worthy men inspired the students with
like sentiments. Every class made great sacrifices
to purchase valuable standard works for
their society libraries. The literary spirit was
by no means in abeyance in those days. The
best minds in college took as much interest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
preparing themselves for debates and other
parts in the two societies as they did for a
Junior and Senior Exhibition. The students
dammed the glen at Paradise Spring and made
a pond. They also terraced the sides of the
glen and constructed seats of turf, and addresses
and poems were delivered there to most appreciative
audiences. Sam Silsbee flung Albion
Andrew into Paradise Pond, and he was so fat
that he floated like a bladder. Sam was not
aware that he was laying sacrilegious hands
upon the future governor of Massachusetts any
more than I was aware that Melville Fuller
would be Chief Justice of the United States,
when with care on his young brow and the
fire of a great purpose in his eye, I marked
him laying the foundation of future renown.
Were there not poets in those days who possessed
the vision and the faculty divine? Did
not President Allen have a hat that was woven
of grass that grew on Mount Parnassus? Did
not John B. Soule compose a Latin ode upon
a moth that flew into a candle which in the
opinion of the class compared favorably with
those of Horace? And has he not since that
time by more elaborate efforts proved that
the child is father of the man? How can I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
ignore a most pathetic effusion, on the death
of an unfortunate cat that was crushed beneath
a woodpile, written in the style of President
Allen?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">“Poor puss, and wast thou to death squeezed</div>
    <div class="verse">Beneath the weighty pile?</div>
    <div class="verse">How must thy life have been outsneezed</div>
    <div class="verse">The agonizing while!</div>
    <div class="verse">And, pussy, didst thou found it hard</div>
    <div class="verse">To part from kittens young?</div>
    <div class="verse">For if thou’dst not a feeling heart,</div>

    <div class="verse">Thy body from thy mind unscrewed,</div>
    <div class="verse">To bleach beneath the snow.</div>
    <div class="verse">By hill and valley, dale and stream,</div>
    <div class="verse">The rats shall frisk and frolic,</div>
    <div class="verse">Crying ’Hurrah, we’ll lick the cream</div>
    <div class="verse">Since pussy’s got the colic.’”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>During the latter part of President Allen’s
administration discipline was lax; intemperance
prevailed to a fearful extent in college as
it did in the community. There were no railroads,
and people came to Commencement and
remained in Brunswick till the close. It was
then customary for the graduating class to
set tables in the rooms in which were liquors
and other refreshments, and entertain their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
relatives and friends. At one time there
was a room in North College in which a
table was set with liquors and other refreshments,
and straw was put upon the floor, and
over the door a sign bearing the inscription, “Entertainment for Man and Beast.” But
even at that time there was a body of students
composing the college church or Praying
Circle, as it was termed, the greater
number of whom were persons of the most
decided religious character. They held meetings
and taught Sabbath-schools in different
parts of the town, and were in sympathy with
every good work; but between them and the
majority of the other students there was a line
of demarcation. Each party travelled their
own road, and they had little to do with one
another. But after 1838 there was a change;
a deep religious interest began and continued,
the herald of a better day. Since that day
Christian associations have exerted a salutary
influence, and, like the Gulf Stream sending
its warm current through the cold waters of
the Atlantic, have imparted a more genial
tone to the intercourse of the students. Athletic
exercises have likewise laid a strong hand
upon much of the time formerly devoted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
more questionable recreations. Although the
present furor in these sports has its dangers
and the matter is liable to abuse, yet they fill
the bill as nothing else ever did, and when
pruned of their excrescences will become a
power for good. Young men of real stamina,
however full of blue veins and vitriol and however
enamoured of baseball, football, and boating,
and hurried to extremes for the moment,
will yet recall and heed the words of Cicero
who represents Milo of Crotona, the greatest
athlete of ancient times, who could kill an ox
with a blow of his fist, shedding idiotic tears
as in his old age he looked upon his flabby
skin and shrunken muscles, and wept because
he could no longer contend and conquer in the
Olympic games. Milo had muscle and nothing
else. May it never be said of Bowdoin students
that they have muscle and nothing else,
and certainly not that they are destitute of it.</p>

<p>Great was the change when President
Woods succeeded President Allen. Never
will the upper classes of that year forget the
day of his inauguration. When he took his
stand upon the platform to deliver his address,
he laid upon the table before him a manuscript
as thick as a three-inch plank. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
riband was passed through it, dividing it into
equal parts. But he never looked at it from
the beginning to the close, except that, when
halfway through, he opened at the riband but
made no use of it. For more than two hours,
without the hesitation of a moment or the
lapse of a word, he held that audience spellbound.
I have never known the man who
could produce the impression&mdash;and a permanent
one&mdash;upon a wild boy that he could.
There are many living, distinguished and beloved,
and many here present who will never
forget their obligations to Leonard Woods.</p>

<p>For a poor boy smitten with the love of
knowledge to work his way through college
was once a formidable task. The only methods
of doing it were keeping school in the long
winter vacation, manual labor as they went
along, or hiring money with the result of being
burdened with debt at graduation. The Education
Society could do but little, and there
were no scholarships as at present. I walked
seventy-five miles over the frozen ground after
Christmas to the Penobscot to keep school, and
back again through the mud in March, because
I was too poor to ride; and I had to hire a
watch in Brunswick to keep school with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>The commonwealth justly expects much
from the students and alumni who enjoy the
advantages both literary and pecuniary now
accorded.</p>

<p class="center">
“Ye are marked men, ye men of Dalecarlia.”<br />
</p>

<p>The associations of this day come home
with peculiar force to the minds of those
who have been familiar with the history and
watched the progress of this college from the
day it was a mere shrub, with bare shade sufficient
to cover its own roots, to this glad hour
when they rejoice that they are permitted to
look upon it as a massive tree, on whose broad
foliage the sunlight loves to linger and the
dew lieth all night on its branches. Withered
hands are lifted in benediction: the tremulous
accents of age join the universal jubilee. They
will depart cheered by the assurance that when
the dial plate shall be taken off from this great
clockwork of the universe, and in eternity we
behold its secret wheels and springs, it will be
found that those who, at this seat of science,
have separated themselves that they might intermeddle
with all knowledge, its officers and
its benefactors, have lived, labored, endured,
not for themselves, but for their country and
their God.</p>

<h3><a name="LOVE" id="LOVE"></a>LOVE</h3>

<p class="center"><small>[Delivered at “Donation Party,” Harpswell, September 18,
1894]</small></p>


<p>Love, my friends and neighbors, is something
that defies definition and resents analysis.
It is not possible to communicate the
perception of it to one who has never experienced
it. It must be felt in order to be
known. It is likewise the most permanent
of all the qualities of the mind. Anger, however
violent, expires with the occasion that
called it forth. Grief, however bitter and
heart-rending, time will remove, and it will
blunt the sting of sorrow. But love is inexhaustible
and grows by what it feeds upon.
Here is the father of a young family. He is
returning at night from his work. As he
approaches the door, a little one who can just
go alone espies him. With cries of delight he
runs to meet his parent, till, out of breath and
strength, he falls exhausted into his father’s
outstretched arms. The happy parent raises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
the little one and kisses him. When he has
kissed that child a dozen times, does he not
want to kiss him a dozen times more? Thus
affection grows by what it feeds upon and is
inexhaustible. It will do or endure more for
the welfare of its object than any other faculty.
You may hire a man to labor for you,
you may force him to obey you, but not to love
you. No power on earth can do that. On
the other hand, does he love you, that love
will cause him to do more for you than all
other motives put together, and the more he
does the more will he delight to do, because
love tells nothing is lost that a good friend
gets.</p>

<div class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Elijah Kellogg at Eighty.</span><br />1893.</div>
</div>


<p>There are people before me to-night whom
I began to love forty years ago. Do I love
them less? Is the affection worn out? No;
it is worn in. Then it was in the bark, but
now it has got into the heart of the tree.</p>

<p>Here, also, are the children and grandchildren
of those who are not, for God has taken
them, and the affection I bore their parents
clings to the children. It is not worn out,
because love is stronger than death. Many
waters cannot quench love, neither can floods
drown it. Or if a man would give all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
substance of his house for love, it would
utterly be contemned. It is love that
makes home, love that makes friends in the
world, love that makes heaven, for God
is love.</p>

<p>What has brought all these friends together
to-night? They did not come to get, but to
give, not with their hands shut up, but with
both hearts and hands wide open. They have
come to gratify their feelings of neighborly
friendship and affection; for if they did not
thus gratify those feelings, they would not
enjoy what they had left. Ought I not to
be grateful to be the recipient of so much
good-will, kindness, and neighborly affection?
I trust it will be an encouragement to render
me more faithful to your souls’ best interests,
to work for you and seek your good; to pray
that God, who loves the cheerful giver, will
reward and bless you.</p>

<p>There were never two persons in this world
who loved each other but wanted and loved
to eat together, and there were never two
enemies who did. There were never two
persons who loved each other, loved God,
but who loved and wanted to pray together.
We have eaten together; we have enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
each other’s society; recalled the feelings of
other and happier days, before toil had stiffened
our limbs, sorrow entered our hearts, or
tears trembled on our eyelids; now let us pray
together before we separate.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_DELUDED_HERMIT" id="THE_DELUDED_HERMIT"></a>THE DELUDED HERMIT</h3>

<p class="center"><small>[Delivered at “Donation Party,” October 1, 1895]</small></p>


<p>In the ancient days, after the early Christian
fathers who succeeded the Apostles had
departed, religion degenerated into superstition.
There arose under the influence of the
Roman Catholic Church a class of hermits,
anchorites, and devotees who thought that
heaven and holiness were to be obtained by
torturing and denying the flesh; that by
secluding themselves from society, by fastings
and watchings, they might escape temptation
and sin and live nearer to God and
merit the divine favor.</p>

<p>In the North Sea are a group of islands
belonging to Denmark, sixteen in number,
called the Färöe Isles, some of which are of
considerable size and inhabited, others mere
patches of rocks and turf. Upon one of these,
which is a mere sand spit flung up by the sea,
a hermit had taken up his residence. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
dwelling was built of the stones of the place,
and the entrance was so low that he went in
and came out on his knees. When the door
was closed, it was lighted by an opening in
the top which permitted a view of the sky, of
the sun when far advanced in the heavens,
of the moon and the stars, but not of the
earth. Here this pious but deluded saint
passed his days in prayer, meditation, frequent
fasting, and reading the Bible. His
food was brought to him by the inhabitants
of the neighboring islands who greatly revered
him for his holiness and sought his
prayers for themselves and their household.
He imagined that if he could see only the
heavens, he should become less earthly; that
by cutting himself off from the sins, the cares,
and the labors of worldly and sinful men and
being alone with God, he should make great
advance in holiness. Poor deluded man! If,
when he looked upon the heavens, the sun, the
moon, and the stars, he had only taken a reasonable
and scriptural view of the purpose for
which they were created, he would have perceived
that it was for the good of others they
were created, to declare the glory of God to a
universe, to cause grass to grow for cattle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
herbs for the use of man; that for six thousand
years they had been holding to all the
nations of the earth their high and perpetual
discourse of the wisdom, power, and goodness
of God, who openeth His liberal hand and satisfieth
the desire of every living thing. Such
reflections would have taught him that if,
instead of spending his life and energies, and
consuming soul and body, in prayers and meditations
that began and ended in themselves, he
had taken a portion of his time to keep the fire
burning on his own hearthstone, and then gone
forth among those islanders and told them
of God and Christ and the duties they owed,
given them the benefit of and shared with
them his wisdom and holiness, and taught
them to love God and each other, it would
have been more acceptable to God, and in
blessing he would have been blessed. This
mistaken man imagined he was crucifying
sin when he was only crucifying the natural
affections and sympathies God had given him
to be gratified for his own good and that of
others. Man was not made to live in a state
of isolation, but in fellowship with his kind.
The human heart craves sympathy just as
naturally as the vine stretches its tendrils to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
clasp some friendly prop, and, failing to reach
it, droops and withers and bears no fruit. He,
who is the centre of many loving hearts,
whose interests, joys, and sorrows are his and
his theirs, is stronger and happier than he who
treads the brier-planted path of life alone, with
no one to lean upon and share the burden or the
conflict with him. We were made to find our
happiness in the happiness of others. When
is a gift valuable? When it is a part of the
heart of him who bestows it. That which
makes the gifts I receive upon occasions like
this of priceless value to me is that they come
from those with whom I have lived in love
and sympathy so long that they have become
part of myself. The Saviour has said
it is more blessed to give than to receive. It
is more blessed to give than to receive. It is
more gratifying to be able to bestow favors
than to be obliged to receive them. It is
more like our Maker. He never receives anything,
for all things are His. He is the universal
giver.... May He who gives us all
things reward you in your persons and in your
households, and grant you that which He sees
is best for your happiness both here and hereafter.</p>

<h3><a name="HOME" id="HOME"></a>HOME</h3>

<p class="center"><small>[Delivered at “Donation Party,” October 19, 1897]</small></p>


<p>The sweetest word that ever trembled on
human lips is the word “home.” It embraces
and concentrates in itself the germs of
a thousand forces of happiness, power, and
progress yet to be developed from it. So long
as man wanders, and, like the savage, merely
gathers what grows of itself from the soil, or
captures the fish of the streams, the birds of
the air, and the beasts that roam the forests,
he makes no progress; he bestows no labor
upon, and therefore takes no interest in, that
abode which he is to abandon to-morrow. It
is only when he has a permanent dwelling
and produces something from the earth that
progress, happiness, and the home relation
begin. Home is the place where character
is built, where sacrifices to contribute to the
happiness of others are made, and where love
has taken up its abode. Love is the strongest
passion of our natures and finds its happiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
in sacrificing for its object; the parent for the
child, the child for the parent, the sister for
the brother. In this relation they are in the
best possible position for moral and intellectual
development; they stimulate and call out
each other’s powers, energies, and affections.</p>

<p>Infinite wisdom has declared, “It is not
good for man to be alone.” There is not a
more unsightly or unprofitable tree than a
white pine growing alone. It is a mass of
knots, knobs, short-jointed, crooked, and wind-shaken,&mdash;in
short, a scrub. The lumbermen
in contempt call it a bull pine. But put a
thousand of them together as near as they can
grow. What a change! As you enter that
majestic cathedral no sunbeam can pierce, and
look up at those heights,&mdash;trees straight as an
arrow seventy feet to a limb,&mdash;you almost feel
like uncovering in reverence. Thus with the
family relation. The happiest homes are those
the members of which are frequently called
to sacrifice something or to deny themselves
something for the others’ comforts and happiness.
It is this that sweetens home. It is
those who bear the burdens of life together,
relying upon and trusting in each other, who
get the most out of life, bear its trials without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
being soured by them, and rear children who
arise and call them blessed&mdash;children that
have real manhood&mdash;who can look danger
in the eye without quailing and grapple to
severe tasks without wilting, and are nobody’s
servants.</p>

<p>It is evident that home is not mere locality,
that it is not defined by metes and bounds.
From Gibraltar to Archangel, from Calcutta
to the frozen seas, there are homes. One
principle, one fruit-bud produces them all.
Home is not a thing that can be bought or
sold in the market. You may buy a homestead
or a house, you may perhaps buy a wife,
but you cannot buy a woman’s love. Costly
furniture, rich dresses, retinues of servants,
and luxurious dishes do not make homes. It
is not the residence but the affection of the
occupants that constitutes the home. Those
who are united in the bonds of a true affection
behold themselves reflected in each other, and
each is to the other as another self. In the
confidence of love there is repose.</p>

<p>My friends and neighbors, this assembly is
made up of those who have been reared and
have reared others in homes where parental
love and filial affection were the mainsprings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
of action and the foundation of charitable and
friendly acts. The desire to share with others
the gifts a kindly Providence bestows on ourselves
is bred in the atmosphere of home. All
the sweet charities of life are but the overflow
of these feelings and sympathies born and
bred at the domestic hearthstone.</p>

<p>I thank you, my friends and neighbors, for
the gifts of affection bestowed this night, and
may the blessing of God rest upon yourselves,
your children, and your homes.</p>

of a sinful course, a course of ingratitude
and disobedience to God. We have placed
before us the life of a Hebrew patriarch. In
that land now so barren beneath the curse of
God and the curse of a despotic government, but
once so full of beauty and blossoming, when
the Chosen People clothed its now barren
mountain peaks with clambering vines and its
valleys with waving grass and grain, dwelt a
Hebrew, a righteous man among the kindred
of his people, to whom God had given goodly
land, and flocks and herds in abundance, whose
tents stretched far over the plains, and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
had servants born in his house. This man had
two sons, one of whom was much older than
the other. It was a pleasant household; the
father was kind and affectionate to his servants
and to the poor,&mdash;a just man, fearing
God and tenderly attached to his children.</p>

<p>As the two brothers were different in their
age, so were they in their dispositions. The
elder son was sober, industrious, and found in
the care of the flocks and the quiet enjoyments
of rural life enough to occupy and interest
him. The father could put confidence
in him, could go away from home and leave
all his business to his care, sure that it would
be completed as if he himself were present.
But though sober, industrious, and trustworthy,
and held by the restraints of his education,
yet he was not of an affectionate and generous
nature, but penurious and severe in his temper,
and much more feared and respected than beloved
by his servants and his equals. But the
younger son was the very opposite. He was
full of life and energy, but fickle and restless,
and directed his energies to no good purpose.
He cared nothing for business nor for cattle.
He would not remain at home, but wandered
from tent to tent and from vineyard to vine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>yard
and into the distant city; the farm life
was dull and distasteful to him. His father
could put no trust in him. If so be that his
father went from home and left him in charge
of the flocks and the servants, he was sure to
find on his return that the flocks had strayed,
that some of them had been lost or devoured
by the wolves, or to find his son frolicking with
the servants instead of directing their labor.
Thus while he could trust the elder son with
everything, he could trust the younger with
nothing, and must always watch him with constant
anxiety.</p>

<p>Yet, with all his faults, the younger son was
generous and affectionate, keen to perceive
and understand, and of great determination to
accomplish when he was so minded. The
father often said to himself: “Oh, that my son
would only do well! How much comfort and
honor would he be to me! And how much
good he might accomplish!” Indeed, it
seemed ofttimes that the boy could not help
his wrong-doing; his wild, frolicsome, headstrong
nature did so hurry him along. Afterward
he would be sorry and even shed tears,
and then go straightway and do the same
again. Yet was the heart of the father more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
after this wild slip of a boy than after the
other.</p>

<p>There is in the heart of the parent a principle,
not possible perhaps to be explained,
which leads him to be more attached to and
indulgent of the youngest child. There is
something also in the very anxiety that the
follies of the disobedient child occasion which
calls out and fosters the affections of the parent
more strongly for him than for the one who
never gives that cause for uneasiness. The
father also felt that the boy, though carried
away by the impulses of his own imaginations
and the romance of his nature and spirit, was
after all of deeper affections and nobler impulses
and greater capacity than the other son,
and had in him all the raw material of a noble,
useful character, could this impetuous spirit
and these burning impulses be subdued, not
destroyed, and these energies wisely directed.
Many a bitter tear he shed, and many a prayer
he put up to God for this child of his love and
his old age.</p>

<p>Matters went on in this way from bad to
worse, the son becoming more and more discontented
and uneasy. He listened to the
tales of travellers who had been to distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
lands and over the sea till his blood boiled, and
he said to himself: “Shall I never see anything
but these same hills and valleys? Shall
I never hear any discourse but about sheep
and goats and fleeces of wool and cheese and
barley? Shall I never see anything of the
great world of which I hear so much? Must
I stay here and milk goats when there is so
much pleasure in the world to be enjoyed?”
But now the time draws near when he shall
be of age and his own master to go where
he pleases. How he has been counting the
days and reckoning up the time when he shall
escape the restraints of home! No sooner has
the time arrived than he goes to his father
and says to him, “Father, give me so much
of your property as belongs to me, my share.”
He does not ask it as a gift, but as a debt
which the father was under obligations to pay
him. What right had he to demand anything
of the father? Had it been his elder brother
who made this demand, who for many years
after he was of age had labored hard and
given the proceeds of his labor into the common
stock, there would have been some justice
in the request. But this man had never done
anything, had spent all he could get, had tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
his father to the utmost, and now had the assurance
to come to his father and say: “Such
a part of the property belongs to me. I want
it, that I may go where I like and spend it as
I wish.” He had been so long in the habit of
receiving from his father without effort of his
own that he had come to consider it as a matter
of right.</p>

<p>The father was pained by this ungrateful
conduct, and the prodigal in his own heart felt
ashamed of himself; in the bottom of his
heart he loved and respected his father, but
the love of pleasure, his lofty imaginations of
the enjoyments to be found in the world of
which he had read, heard, and dreamed so
much, overpowered all other feelings. Could
he only escape from the restraints of home
and obtain money and means to gratify his
desires, he should be happy. The father without
any reproach divides his living and gives
to him his share. He has never seen so much
money before in his life. He is mad with
joy. He thinks it will never be exhausted.
He can hardly stop to bid good-by to his family,
to his father whose heart aches to see this
son of his love so glad to leave him. He takes
his journey into a far country, just as far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
home as he can get, that his friends may not
be able to know what he is doing or to trouble
him with advice. He’s had advice enough.
He’s had enough of home. He’s going to try
the world. Now he gives loose rein to all his
lusts. He is soon surrounded by a circle of
generous, jovial companions who would die
for him; who every day pledge him health
and happiness in the social glass; who, so far
from troubling him with advice, tell him he is a
noble-hearted, princely fellow, and that everything
he says and does is just right. How
much better they are than his father’s old,
stupid, hard-working servants, or than his
sober brother who thought only of sheep and
begrudged him every cent, or than his father
who was always telling him about the temptations
of life! These noble, large-hearted fellows
tell him money is made to spend and life
is made to enjoy.</p>

<p>While he is thus going onward in the pursuit
of pleasure, there comes a famine in the
land. The prices of food rise to a fearful extent.
His money is exhausted, and he is
amazed to find that his friends so kind begin
to cool in their affections just in proportion
as his means diminish. He finds that, so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
from dying for him, their intention is to live
upon him till he has nothing left and then reproach
him for his extravagance. The friend
who begged him to make his house his home,
just as though he were in his own father’s
house, intimates that times are very hard and
every one must look out for himself. Hunger
succeeds and rags. He who never had a serious
thought before is serious enough now. He
who never bestowed a thought upon food or
raiment must now find food or perish. In
his necessity he resorts to the house of a
farmer and with humble tone begs work. He
who demanded of his father the property he
had never earned a dollar of begs for the
meanest employment that may keep him
from starving! The farmer tells him that
he may go into his fields and feed swine and
eat a morsel with the servants in the kitchen.
But the servants’ fare is scanty, just sufficient
to preserve life. In the morning after taking
his morsel, he goes with a heavy heart to his
work. What a contrast! He thought his
home lonesome; but where and what is he
now? All around him the land is scorched,
the streams are dry, the trees leafless. He
thought it hard to feed cattle; he must now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
feed hogs and beg for the privilege. Corn is
so scarce that the swine can have only the
husks, and he is so hungry that he would fain
fill himself with the husks that the swine eat
and no man gives unto him. Not one of all
his former friends upon whom he has spent
so much will give him a crust.</p>

<p>He now comes to himself; for the first time
in his life he begins to think. He thinks of
his kind old father, of his home where there
is plenty. He says, “How many servants of
my father have bread enough and to spare,
and I perish with hunger!” He says, “Shall
I go home?” Pride whispers: “Go home?
How can I look upon my father’s face, on my
brother who was always steady and industrious,
and the old neighbors? My very looks
will tell what I am, and where I have been,
and what I have been doing. No, I won’t
go home. I can’t go home. I will starve to
death first.” But it is much easier to talk
about starving than it is to starve. Hunger
and poverty are hard masters. Long is the
struggle, terrible. At length he decides. “I
will go while I have strength enough left to
get there. ’I will arise and go to my father,
and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no
more worthy to be called thy son.’” And
before his resolution has time to cool, he sets
out on his journey.</p>

<p>How truly and strikingly does this illustrate
the condition of one who wanders from
God, and breaks the commands and deserts
the house of his Father in heaven. A young
man has grown up the inmate of a Christian
family, but God has created him. His abilities
of body and mind are from God. The
property which he acquires, the ability to
obtain it, and the opportunity and the time
are God’s ability, God’s property, God’s time.
God declares that by using these in his service,
he shall be happy in life, and in eternity
receive the crown of glory. But these commands
are not agreeable to him any more than
the commands of the father were to the prodigal.
He does not feel that his abilities and
happiness are the gift of God, that he is under
any obligation to his Father in heaven. In
the flush of youth and health and hot blood,
he feels that his strength is the strength of
stones and his flesh brass. He says to his
heavenly, as the prodigal to his earthly,
Father, “Give me the portion of goods that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
falleth to me.” He feels that they are his
own to use as he pleases, and thus he means
to do; though like the prodigal all the return
he has ever made to God is to sin against Him.
He loves not to think of God and eternity and
Christ and sin. So, like the son in the parable,
he goes into a far country.</p>

<p>It is not literal space that is here meant;
it is the distance of thought and feeling and
affections and obedience. A man need not go
out of his country to get far from God. At
home, in the practice of all the outward duties
of morality, regular in the attendance upon
the sanctuary, he may yet live as far from
God, as unwilling to submit to His commands,
as though living in the most disorderly manner
and in open sin. But whether on the
ocean and in foreign lands he lives in sin
and spends his substance in riotous living
and looks everywhere among all forbidden
pleasures for happiness, or on the land conceals
a proud heart under a correct life, the
result is that he is wretched, finds no peace.
But now the Spirit of God touches his heart,
leads him to reflect upon his true condition.
He comes to himself. “I have broken the
laws. I have grieved thy spirit. I deserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
not the least of thy mercies. Do with me
what seemeth good in thy sight.” But then
the thought arises,&mdash;and it is a bitter one,&mdash;”How
can I go into the presence of that
pure and holy God? I, so vile a sinner, who
have blasphemed His name! Can such a
sin be forgiven?”</p>

<p>Let us now consider the reception the son
meets with. It is noontide, the time of
burning heat. The cattle have sought the
groves and the cool places of the hills, or
are standing in the running streams beneath
the tall reeds of the jungles. The goats seek
the clefts of the rocks. In his tent door, beneath
the drooping branches of a sycamore
that screen it from the sun, sits an aged patriarch.
On his face is that submissive look that
neither tongue nor pen can describe, and that
tells of high and holy communion with God.
All around is peace inviting to repose. The
faint breath of the dying breeze is gently
rustling the leaves mingling with the hum
of bees and the low murmur of a distant
brook. The servants are sleeping in the
shadow. But the old patriarch slumbers not
with his slumbering servants. On his meek
face is a troubled look, and now and then a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
silent tear steals down his cheek and falls
upon his clasped hands. He is thinking of
his absent, dearly loved, wayward child!
From the past he argues disastrously of the
future. If so headstrong and reckless under
the mild restraint of home, what will become
of him when all check is removed? Where
is he, on sea or on land, this child of many
prayers, many counsels, and bitter anxieties?
Is he living in riot and folly, or is he already
in suffering and distress, having not where to
lay his head? Has he remembered any of
the words of affectionate counsel that have
been spoken to him? Do his thoughts ever
turn toward his home and the friends of
his youth?</p>

<p>While the good father is thus sitting in his
tent door praying for and thinking of his son,
he sees a traveller far off upon the plains, so
far that he just discerns him. He thinks,
What if that should be my son? So he steps
out from the tent door and he looks long and
eagerly, for the traveller comes slowly. But
as he approaches, the father sees he is lame,
footsore, and ragged, and his heart tells him: “This is just the condition in which I might
expect my son to come. Ah, yes, that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
he.” And instantly the father runs to meet
him.</p>

<p>But what are the feelings of the prodigal as
he draws near his native country and the old
familiar features of the landscape strike his
eye, and he sees in the distance his father’s
tent and the old trees under whose shadows
he played when a boy? How does he feel?
He does not feel one-half the resolution he
did when he set out. His hope which at first
sustained him begins to waver. He does not
feel so much confidence now as he did when
he was farther off. He begins to think of his
rags, and the appearance he makes. He goes
into the thicket and washes his face in the
brook and sleeks up his rags, and tries to make
himself look decent and respectable to meet
his father. But it is no use. Wherever he
touches them they tear and finally fall off
altogether, they are so rotten. At length he
gives up in despair and says: “Well, I must
go as I am, miserable wretch. I can’t make
myself any better; the more I try the worse
I look. There’s nothing to make decency out
of. Oh! what will my father say to me, miserable?
God help me!”</p>

<p>While he is thus talking and going along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
he sees his father in the tent door. “Oh,”
he says, “there is my father now!” Then he
stops right short in the road and looks down
upon the ground, and is of a good mind to
turn back and run away. But while he is
hesitating, his father comes running and falls
right on his neck and kisses him. And when
he feels his old father’s arms embracing him,
his lips on his cheeks, and his tears on his
neck,&mdash;oh, that is the worst of all. Then his
heart is like to break with sorrow. He did
not expect such treatment as this. If his
father had only reproached him and said, “You
vile, wicked boy, is this what you have come
to?” he could bear that better. But this
kindness and love,&mdash;it quite breaks his heart.
Then as soon as he can find voice for tears,
he slips out of his father’s arms and falls down
on his knees and says: “’Father, I have sinned
against heaven and before thee, and am no
more worthy to be called thy son.’ Don’t call
me son; it breaks my heart. Make me thy
servant, thy slave. Thou didst give me a
goodly fortune which I never earned a dollar
of. I have spent it all in folly, wasted thy
substance, and disgraced thy name in foreign
lands wherever I have been. I come here in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
wretchedness and rags to disgrace thee still
more among the neighbors that know thee and
thy goodness. Now, Father, let me be thy
servant and serve thee, that I may earn thee
something to atone for spending thy property
and to show that I am really sorry.” But
the father will hear nothing of all this, and
while he is speaking, cuts him short, saying
to the servants who stand wondering, “Bring
forth the best robe; take off his rags; wash his
sores; put a ring on his hands, and shoes on
his feet: and bring hither the fatted calf and
kill it; for this my son was dead, and is alive
again; he was lost, and is found.”</p>

<p>Thus it is with the returning and repentant
sinner. When he is far from God and is first
drawn by the Spirit and assured by revelations
of His mercy, he with considerable courage
begins to seek and pray. But as he comes
nearer and the light from the Excellent Glory
grows stronger, and he sees more of his sins,
he begins to doubt and to falter. But when God
sees him thus afar off, sees a little love in his
heart, He comes to meet him. He puts the
robe of Christ upon him and gives to him the
signet ring.</p>

<p>My dear friends who are out of Christ, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
are away from home. You are perishing.
You have no food for your souls. You will
die and be lost. Why sit here and perish
in a foreign land? Why feed on husks when
you may have the choicest of the wheat? There
is bread enough in your father’s house. Many
have gone there; more are on the road; others
are coming. Won’t you join the goodly company?
Be resolute. Say, “I will.” Be resolute
as in the emergencies of life and business;
as when the lee shore is on one side and the
gale on the other, and the seaman presses the
canvas on the cracking spars and the straining
rigging, and the ship must carry it or be
dashed upon the breakers; be resolute as when
one sees his friend perishing in the water
and says, “I will save him or die with
him.”</p>

<p>My dear hearers, won’t you say: “I will go.
Nothing shall keep me back from my Saviour.
Sins nor fears nor devils shall not stop me. I
will try if I die. I know that God is merciful.”</p>

<h3><a name="WRESTING_THE_SCRIPTURES" id="WRESTING_THE_SCRIPTURES"></a>WRESTING THE SCRIPTURES</h3>

<p>The Second Epistle of Peter, Chapter III,
part of 16th verse. “<i>In which are some
things hard to be understood, which they that
are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do
also the other Scriptures, unto their own
destruction.</i>”</p>


<p>In speaking from this text I might dilate
upon the etymology of the words “unlearned”
and “unstable.” I might go on to observe
that we must take the Bible as a whole and
be taught of the Spirit in order to practice
its plain truths and fathom its more difficult
ones; that as in the schools of human science
the elementary text-books are simple while
those designed for the advanced classes are
more abstruse, thus the Bible contains many
things which are now far beyond the reach of
our minds, but to the comprehension of which
we shall clamber up in eternity; that in the
Bible, the book of time and eternity, the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
volumes are bound in one. Here we only
read the preface and the introduction; in the
hereafter we shall peruse the whole of the
book.</p>

<p>But as these themes are frequently discussed
with more of learning than I can presume
to bring to the task, I shall pursue a
less beaten path and content myself with
observing that to “wrest” a thing signifies to
wrench or twist it from its true position; the
very word implies violence. Thus to wrest a
truth of Scripture signifies to detach it from
the other truths of the system, to make it bear
a false meaning, or to rob it of all meaning.
A truth of Scripture thus wrested is no longer
a truth, and is, therefore, of no avail to the
man who has wrested it. It can do him no
good; he can no more get to heaven with it
than a man who should tear a plank or a
breast-hook from a ship could cross the Atlantic
upon it. But as there are capillary veins
and nerves in the bodily organization which
discharge important though minute functions,
and becoming diseased affect larger vessels
and tissues, the consequence of which is sickness,
and the result death, so there are methods
of wresting the Scriptures less violent but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
less fatal in their consequences. So great, my
friends, is the evil bias of our nature and so
deceitful is the human heart that we are prone
to deceive ourselves, imagining that we are
doing the will of God while we are doing
our own will, obeying while we are wresting
the Scriptures. This principle, following the
example of Jesus of Nazareth, I will illustrate
by a parable.</p>

<p>In that never-to-be-forgotten year when the
Pilgrim Fathers of New England rose up from
their knees beneath the cliffs of Holland and
embarked, there dwelt, where Derwent-Water
pours its swift current into the black gorges
of a lonely tarn, the descendant of a house,
rich in ancestral memories and renowned in
arms. Often had these massive walls rung
to the battle clarion and its floors echoed to
the tread of mail-clad men. But their descendant,
though inheriting all the lofty heroism
of his race, is, with a heart subdued by grace,
a man of scholarly tastes, of peace, and of
God.</p>

<p>Amid the family circle where are the mother
that reared, the wife that cherishes him, and
the children who climb his knees, he lives,
labors, and prays. “Surely,” said some looker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
at the outward appearance, “this man does not
serve God for naught. Has not God made a
hedge about him and all that he has? He
would have his good things in both lives. Is
he willing to sacrifice anything? Would he
do anything with the Cross of Christ other
than build it into the masonry of his castles
or inscribe it upon the banner folds of his
vassals?” Let us see.</p>

<p>He enters his library, a room of antique
mould; the roof groined and blazoned reflects
a thousand hues of soft light from lamps of
fretted gold. The thickly carpeted floor returns
no echo to the footfall. View him as
he stands beneath that mellow light: The
face is the face of a prophet. The pure white
brow, which no hardship has bronzed and
around which the locks of early manhood are
clustering, is as radiant with goodness as
heaven’s own light. The eyes suffused, not
dimmed, by that mist which is the forerunner
of tears, are turned toward heaven, while
from their calm depths, pure as those through
which wanders the light of stars, beam glances
of gentle affection, a humility not assumed but
ingrained like the summer flush upon the cheek
of a ripened grape. The strong, firm lips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
are slightly parted with an expression of
purpose and action; motionless they seem
to utter, “Father, what wilt Thou have me
to do?”</p>

<p>Thoughtful he stands, then bows that stately
head in deep contrition before God. He kneels,
indeed, upon an embroidered cushion, but it is
wet with tears. This man of noble blood and
old descent, who sayeth “to this man ’Go,’
and he goeth, and to another ’Come,’ and he
cometh,” grovels in the dust before his Maker.
In his anguish he prostrates himself upon the
floor; he cannot get low enough before his
God. It is in his heart to embark with the
Pilgrims, and he asks counsel of Heaven: “Father, wilt Thou that I leave these towers
of my ancestors, moistened with their blood
and beneath whose shadows their bones lie
mouldering, and my mother now in the wane
of life? Wilt Thou that I should take the
wife of my bosom, my little ones reared in
luxury and with tenderness, that I myself
ever having lived and loved among the
gifted and the great should go forth with my
brethren to the wilderness? Tell me, O my
Father, that it is my duty, and I will fling
my whole estate into thy treasury as will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>ingly
as ever prodigal wasted his in riotous
living; I will venture my life and the lives of
those dearer to me than my own as readily as
ever one of my warrior ancestors laid lance
in rest to break a hedge of spears. Thou
knowest that I love mother, wife, and children,
comfort, refinement, wealth; that life is
sweet to the lusty and the young. Thou
knowest how dear to me are these old trees
beneath which in childhood I played, these
swelling hills, these gently sloping vales, this
fair stream whose gleam I love at the sunset
hour to catch through green foliage and to
whose murmur I love to listen, this chosen
retreat filled with books that embalm the lore
of centuries whither I may retire after drinking
a thousand inspirations from without, and
in silent prayer and thought make them my
own, growing in the reaches of my lonely
thought to greater affluence of progress and
power. But I love Thee, O Lord Jesus Christ,
my Saviour, more than these; therefore let me
go. Already my brother and my kindred
deem that I shrink from sacrifice and thus
shall thy name be dishonored through me.
Thou lovest me not, else wouldst Thou
chasten me, wouldst permit me to endure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
hardness. Surely I am a bastard and no son.
He that never suffered never loved.”</p>

<p>But while thus he prays and pleads, a voice
from the Excellent Glory whispers to his soul: “I know thou lovest me. Yet shalt thou not
embark. In Abraham I accepted the full purpose
and the firm intent; so will I in regard
to thee. I have in reserve for thee tasks as
stern, and sacrifices as great, as the forests of
America can furnish, tasks for which I created
thee and gave thee thy capacities. Thy forefathers
were men of brawn, but thou art a
man of mind. Have not I chosen the men
who are to go? Their flesh is hard, their
bones are strong to bear the harness, and
their whole course of thought is of a sterner
cast, better fitted than thine to bear the sword
and set the battle in array. It is not my will
that the fire shall die upon the ancient altars;
remain thou to quicken its flame. I will not
that thy mother, that old saint who hath
reared her household in the nurture and admonition
of the Lord, shall in her old age
lack the protection of the son best fitted of
all her race to cherish her declining years; for
I am a covenant-keeping God. Remain, therefore,
to lay thy hand upon her eyes. Learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>ing,
eloquence, and passing knowledge to
bend the minds of men of all ranks to thy
wish are thine. Go then into the councils
of the nation, there to use thy power for me,
to moderate the fierceness of persecution and
send succor to those who are to go forth with
the wolf and the bear to the hillside. There
are keener pangs than those born of flowing
blood and stiffening wounds on lonely battlefields,
gashes deeper than the tomahawk and
the scalping knife can make, wrestlings more
terrible than those with flesh and blood. Fear
not that thou shalt lack occasions to prove thy
zeal. Thou shalt find all the sunny memories
of thy life turned to gall. The church to
whose altar thy mother had thee linked with
all the sweet memories of thy childhood shall
close to thee its doors. Thy children shall be
excluded from those seats of learning where
their kindred and their mates resort. And
thou must endure all these things being
among them, and thus the iron will be
pressed into thy soul day by day, which is
more terrible than to endure in a foreign land
where thou art equal to thy fellows in suffering
and in privilege. These are sterner trials
to the flesh and to the faith, than when war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
horses are neighing and clarions sounding to
the charge, and the maddening rush and roar
of conflict impart the very courage they require
to rush on perils and set thy life upon
a cast. Over the wreck of chosen thoughts
and blighted hopes, through the anguish of
susceptibilities which refinement and culture
have made capacious of suffering of which
under natures are incapable, shalt thou glorify
me.” Yet how many a short-sighted onlooker
at that day, unable to appreciate the inward
motive, judged him who remained as shrinking
from the reproach of the Cross and wresting
the Scriptures to suit a carnal policy and
the love of ease.</p>

<p>Let us view this principle in yet another
light. In a distant apartment of the same
castle is seated one whose features, though of
a stronger and sterner cast, browned by toils
and exposure on fields of battle, still bear
that family resemblance which denotes them
brothers. But his limbs are cast in nature’s
stronger mould, and his hand turns naturally
to the sword hilt. Upon his knees is a
bundle of letters that he peruses with eager
interest. They are from the exiles in Holland,
informing him of the time of their departure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
and urging him to join them. And among
the letters are some from his old companions
in the war of the low countries. Wrapped in
thought the hours pass by him unheeded. At
length, rising suddenly to his feet and thrusting
open the door that leads to the great hall
of the castle, he paces the stone floor. His
eye kindles as it glances over the portraits of
grim warriors and the proud trappings that
adorn its walls. He stops in his lofty stride,
a frown gathers upon his brow, his hand grips
to the hilt of the sword at his side. He has
made up his mind. His is the giant strength
and haughty pride of an heroic line. Retiring
to his chamber, he likewise kneels to pray,
while the frown of anticipated conflicts and
the flush of stirring memories have scarce yet
faded from his brow. But there is no tremor
in the hard tones of his voice, none of those
bitter tears that wet the pillow of the other
fall from his eyes. There is no breaking down
of the strong man before Him who is stronger
than the strong man armed. But he prays
like Henry the Fifth at Agincourt or Bruce
at Bannockburn. To carry his point he prays “my will be done” with the spirit of those
who inscribed upon the muzzles of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
cannon, “O Lord, open thou my lips; and my
mouth shall shew forth thy praise.”</p>

<p>This man has condescended to help God.
Through the long tempestuous voyage, those
fearful months of mingled famine and plague
when the icy breath of winter penetrated even
to the pillows of the dying, and the Pilgrims
drove the ploughshare through the graves of
those most dear to them lest the savage should
count the dead and ascertain their weakness,
he passed unbroken. Neither hunger nor sickness
bows his iron frame nor breaks his
haughty spirit, and yet, unknown to himself,
he is all the while wresting the truths of
Scripture, and deems he is doing the will of
God while he is consulting his own inclinations.
Is the discipline of Providence therefore
to waste itself upon this rugged nature,
only to be repelled like the surf from the
rock, in broken wreaths of foam? Will he
never become as a little child that he may
enter into the kingdom?</p>

<p>Yes. His daughter is dying. The daughter,
the only remaining member of a once
numerous household, whom he loves with an
affection the more absorbing since he loves
nothing else, to whom he has given the scanty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
morsel suffering hunger himself, whom he
pressed to his bosom in the long nights of
that terrible winter that she might gather
warmth from his hardier frame, and around
whom cluster all the affections that throb
beneath the crust of his rugged nature, as the
oak wrappeth its roots about the place of
stones,&mdash;that daughter is dying. Though it is
now the Indian summer and an abundant harvest
has scattered plenty among the dwellings
of the exiles, his daughter is perishing beneath
the terrible exposure she has endured. Upon
her delicate frame the previous winter and
spring have done their work. Stretched upon
a couch of skins, she is fading like the yellow
and falling leaves that the forest is showering
upon the roof, and the morning breeze is gathering
in little heaps around the threshold of
the rude cabin. The strong man has met one
stronger than himself. The arrow aimed by
no uncertain hand has found the joints of the
harness. A sweet smile begotten of that peace
of God, which passeth all understanding, mingles
with the hectic flush on her cheek; and as
he watches the ebbing tide of life, every sigh
of pain, every frown that furrows the pale
brow, wrung from her by the agony of disso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>lution,
shakes his iron frame. But it is suffering,
not submission. She lifts her finger, and
he is at her side, takes her head upon his broad
shoulder, and his war-worn cheek is pressed to
hers, while the golden locks mingle with his
white hairs like sunbeams reposing upon a
fleecy cloud, as he listens to her low speech.</p>

<p>“Father, I must soon leave thee.” A hot
tear falling on her cheek is the only reply. “Father,” she says, laying her thin finger
upon a yellow leaf that an eddy of the wind
just then blew in at the open door upon the
bed, “I am like this leaf, almost at my journey’s
end.”</p>

<p>“I know it, my child,” is the low answer.</p>

<p>“Canst thou give me up?”</p>

<p>“I cannot give thee up. Not a drop of my
blood flows in any living being but in thee,
the blood of a noble race. I had thought that
in this new soil, transplanted, the old oak
might flourish with renewed strength; but
over thee, the dearest and the last, is creeping
the shadow of the grave. My sons died
a soldier’s death, and I mourned them as a
soldier should. Thy mother I married as the
great marry, for reasons of state and policy,
but thou with thy gentle ways hast knit thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>self
into my very heart, and I must lay thee
in a nameless grave, and conceal it from the
Indian’s gaze, while thy kindred sleep beneath
sculptured marble and the shadow of proud
banner folds. Thine uncle who thought to
take the journey with us flinched when it
came to the trial, while I have faced pestilence,
treachery, and war. Surely I have
borne a heavy cross, and thus am I rewarded.
God is too hard with me. He has no right
to bereave me in my old age of the only being
I ever truly loved.”</p>

<p>“Father, whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth.”</p>

<p>“Dear child, torture me not thus or I shall
go mad.”</p>

<p>“No, father, but thou wilt go mad if, in
this desperate sorrow, thou dost not win
Heaven’s grace. If thy heart does not break
in penitence, thy brain will reel in madness.
Father, dear father, it becomes me to seek
knowledge of thy gray hairs, and thou art
esteemed by all a man of shrewd counsel. But
to those who, like me, are on the brink of
eternity, there is given a knowledge not of
earth, and through these weak lips the spirit
speaks. Deceive not thyself. Thou hast as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
yet borne no cross, but thou hast wrested the
Scriptures. May it not be to thine own destruction.
Thy spirit could not brook oppression,
and, as thou couldst not resist, so hast
thou fled from it. The perils of exile and
the stormy seas were less terrible to thee than
the foot of the oppressor on thy neck. Thou
wast bred amid the alarms and in the bloody
frays of the border wars; thou hast loved the
clash of steel, and the smoke of battle is as
the breath of thy nostrils. Thou hast been a
man of blood from thy youth up. My uncle
was bred a scholar amid home delights, unused
to scenes of trial and hardship. They
had terrors for him, whereas they had none
for thee. And yet he would have gladly
come with us had he not been forbidden of
Heaven. I heard him pleading with God to
make known to him his duty. That which
would have been to him a real cross but was
none to thee he was willing to take up. But
God has laid upon him a weightier one at
home. Thus hast thou prayed to have thine
own way, hast suffered in accordance with
thine own will, not the will of God. The
cross, the real cross, is now before thee. Wilt
thou take it up? If thou dost not do this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
father, whither I go thou canst not come.
For nineteen years thou hast anticipated my
slightest wish. Wilt thou now refuse my
last request? I, a timid maid, a daughter of
affluence and luxury, who had never listened
to a harsher sound than the murmur of Derwent-Water
over the rocky bed and the breath
of morn among the hills, have broken every
tie, torn from my heart the youth I loved,
because he stood between me and Christ, encountered
perils before which warriors quail,
for the love of Jesus. I have drunk of the
bitter cup, but the cross has brought me to
the crown. I see it. It glitters in the hand
of Christ. Soon it shall press my brow.
Never in the flush of youth and love in my
early home did I know such joy as in this
savage wilderness, this rude hut, and at this
dying hour fills my soul. So will the cross
bring thee to the crown. Dear father, wilt
thou not say, ’Thy will be done’?”</p>

<p>The words died upon her lips like the murmur
of distant music. Her head which in the
last energies of expiring nature she had raised
from his shoulder fell back, and she passed
away even on his bosom. The red light of
morning fell on that still cold face on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
the strong man’s tears were showering like
the summer rain, but they were tears of submission.
In that midnight vigil he had lived
years, had fathomed the difference between
doing the will of God when it suited and
when it crossed his inclination, between wresting
and wrenching the Scriptures into conformity
with a haughty spirit and bringing
that spirit into obedience to the truth; between
making a cross to suit ourselves and
then bearing it in our own strength and for
our own glory, and taking up that which
Christ places before us.</p>

<p>Are we, my dear friends, wresting the Scriptures,
picking and choosing among the commands
of God, and obeying only those that
run parallel with our inclinations? Have you
gone just so far in obeying the commands of
God as fashion and the custom of your acquaintances
would go and stopped short when
duty became self-denial? Have you done just
as little for Christ as you thought could in
any way consist with a fair profession in the
eyes of the world, and have you gone just as
far in the pleasures of the world as you in
your judgment might go and still escape the
fate of the unbeliever?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<p>Some persons wrest the Scriptures with a
rude force, a noisy and destructive violence,
denying the existence and attributes of their
Maker, and are open scoffers and unbelievers;
but others with a silent, imperceptible force,
unperceived even by themselves, and silent
as the power of frost which lifts the whole
northern continent upon its shoulders. Their
morality, Christian culture, urbanity of deportment,
earnestness in defence of sound doctrine,
private and public charities, are not grounded
on a new heart, but proceed from other motives;
force of education, the restraints of society, the
love of a sect, connection of religion with some
political opinion, and not from the spirit of
love to Christ which it breathes; they spring
from the desire to be reconciled to God by
something less galling to the pride of the
human heart than unconditional surrender.
My friends, receiving the doctrines of Scripture
without obeying their requirements is a
plain and palpable wresting of the Scriptures.
You believe there is a God whose hand rules
the universe, yet you have never bent the knee
to ask for His direction or to thank Him for the
mercies He has bestowed. You believe that
you must strive to enter in at the strait gate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
yet you have never striven. You believe that
when a person feels in his soul the strivings
of the Holy Spirit directing him to God,
he ought, if he would be saved, to fall in
with and supplement them by his own efforts.
You have felt these strivings, yet you have
never lifted a finger to help yourselves. Is
not this holding the truth in unrighteousness?</p>

<p>Delay is wresting the Scriptures. God saith, “Now is the accepted time.” Unbelief says, “Will not another time do just as well?”
God says, “To-day if you will hear his voice.”
Procrastination says, “Will not to-morrow do
as well?” God says, “You know not what
a day may bring forth.” The careless hearer
says, “To-morrow shall be as this day and
much more abundant.” Thus you think one
thing and do another. This is not the way
to live, and certainly it is not the way to die.
Remove, I entreat you by faith and repentance,
this strange discrepancy between faith and
practice.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_BEAUTY_OF_THE_AUTUMN" id="THE_BEAUTY_OF_THE_AUTUMN"></a>THE BEAUTY OF THE AUTUMN</h3>

<p class="center"><small>[From a sermon to Bowdoin Students, October, 1889.]</small></p>


<p>Autumn is a most beautiful and joyous season
of the year; more so even than spring.
The winds are low, and rich with a solemn
music. The days are clear and bright and
have an element of assurance that pertains not
to the changeful skies of April. The air is
bracing and salubrious. The drapery of nature
is gorgeous with the blended beauty of infinite
hues. The crimson and scarlet of the oaks,
the bright yellow of the birch, the bluish
green of the willows contrasted with the brown
and orange of the soil and rocks, are all radiant
in the sunlight and the keen frosty air.
The rich yellow of the corn bursting from the
husk, the loaded stalks swaying heavily in the
October wind, all combine to form a picture
more beautiful, far more satisfactory, than
spring presents. Spring is the season of hope,
yet it is hope deferred. Many unforeseen casu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>alties
may destroy the crop before it is ripe
for the sickle. But harvest is hope realized.
It is the time of taking possession.</p>

<p>Thus it is with the servant of God. The
autumn of his life is more glorious than its
spring. That was hope; this is reality. Then
a long road beset with perils lay before him;
now they have been passed. Notwithstanding
his trials, life has been sweet. It has not been
altogether toil. He has beheld with open sense
this glorious world and appreciated what the
Creator has done for the happiness of his creatures.
The song of birds, the breath of flowers,
the majesty of seas, and the grandeur of mountains
and of forests, the hope of spring, the
beauty of summer, and the sweet companionship
of kindred hearts, have all been his. But
now he is to possess the source of all that so
delighted him. He is to grasp that unseen
hand that led him when he knew it not, and
held the tangled thread of his daily life. He
is to exchange the stream for the fountain, the
sunbeam for the sun itself. The journey has
not been without much of profit and pleasure,
and the heart of the wayfarer has been cheered
by messages from loved ones, but he would
rather be at home. He who made the flower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
is lovelier than the flower. He who gave the
grace doth the grace exceed. To sow the seed
and watch its growth has been a hopeful labor,
but it is better to bind the sheaves. Rich are
the fading splendors of the autumn and gorgeous
the dyes in which the Almighty has
decked the departing year. Sweet the murmur
of autumnal winds among the falling leaves
mingling with the deeper cadence of the streams.
But a brighter glory illumines the autumn of
life that has been spent with God and for God.
What language shall describe, what figures
worthily set forth, the maturity of a soul that
in these days of secular knowledge and Gospel
privilege has gathered to itself, with a sanctified
avarice, all that God has taught in the
mighty utterances of nature and the clearer
revelation of His word, that has laid art and
science under contribution and grappled to
every opportunity of intellectual and spiritual
growth, that by trial has been refined, and by
blessings quickened to a higher measure of
gratitude and love.</p>

<p>Permit one united to you by the college tie
to which time only adds intensity and depth,
who has travelled over the path your feet are
now pressing, who has reached that period of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
life when the tissue of the dream robe has
fallen and when dreams unchilled by truth no
longer minister that maddening fuel to the
feverish blood, permit one to inquire if you
are laying the foundations for such a maturity
as has been described. You are living in a
day that affords opportunity and likewise
compels responsibility. Inspired by such
sentiments, using aright your splendid opportunities
and holding yourself true to your
great responsibilities, may you resemble trees
planted by living waters. May you be enrolled
among the inhabitants of the city that
hath foundations built by God on the banks
of that river</p>

<h3><a name="THE_ANCHOR_OF_HOPE" id="THE_ANCHOR_OF_HOPE"></a>THE ANCHOR OF HOPE</h3>



<p><small>[From a sermon preached at the Second Parish church,
Portland, Maine, on Sunday, August 5, 1900, “Old Home
Week.”]</small></p>

<p>Hebrews vi. 19. “<i>Which hope we have as
an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast,
and which entereth into that within the veil.</i>”</p>


<p>The apostle declares that the relation of a
hope in Christ to the soul is the same as that
of the anchor to the ship.</p>

<p>The value of an anchor in emergencies is
well known. A large ship filled with passengers
is making her passage in midwinter
across the western ocean. As she strikes
soundings the weather thickens. The wind
is easterly; the gale increases; the sea makes;
snow begins to fall; and no pilot is to be
found. But confident, too confident, of his
ability, the master, unwilling to lie off, runs
into the narrow channel of Boston Bay. The
gale increases; the snow thickens. Sail after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
sail is taken in until the ship under short canvas
can no longer hold her own, but makes
leeway continually. Suddenly arises the cry, “Breakers to leeward! Breakers to leeward!”
and the seamen behold the long,
black line of ragged rocks and the white surf
that breaks upon them, where the strongest
ship becomes in a few moments like the chips
and bark that fell from her timbers in framing.</p>

<p>There is now but one resource. Canvas
can do no more. The navigator’s expedients
are exhausted. There is but one hope left to
cling to. The anchor may bring her up.
With the skill and energy of men working
for their own lives and the lives of those
dependent upon their exertions, the ship is
brought to and the anchors are let go. The
ship trembles as fathom after fathom of massive
chain is jerked through the hawse-holes.
The fire flies from the iron folds that encircle
the windlass, and, as she comes up to that
terrific sea breaking mountains high, taking
it over both shoulders and filling her whole
waist with water, pitching and wallowing till
every stick seems about ready to go out of
her, and the windlass itself to be carried into
the bows, anxious eyes look ahead at the seas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
and astern at the breakers. A cry is heard: “She drags! She drags! The surf is bringing
the anchors home! They won’t hold!”
Every cheek grows pale and strong men
tremble.</p>

<p>Presently there is another cry: “Now she
holds! She holds! The anchors have got
her!” And men who have not spoken together
during the voyage embrace each other
for joy. The last link of scope is given; the
chains are weather-bitted; the slatting canvas
is furled; the yards are sharpened to the wind,
and then she lies in that tremendous surf,
whose pitiless diapason drowns every other
sound&mdash;two hundred souls depending for
life upon the links of those chains and the
strength and clutch of those anchors.</p>

<p>Thus with the soul of man. Without the
Christian hope it is a ship without an anchor,
adrift on a stormy sea, at the mercy of its
own passions, the temptations of life, and the
wiles of the devil. These are the tempests
which the soul must meet and struggle with;
and, destitute of the gospel anchor, it must
make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience.</p>

<p>The anchor is the seaman’s last resort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
He has many expedients with which to battle
and make head against the tempest, but when
all other methods fail, then the anchor must
bring her up or she is lost.</p>

<p>Thus the Christian, when all other expedients
fail, when his own strength is but weakness,
flings himself upon the mercy of God,
and moors head and stern to the eternal
promise and the covenants of grace.</p>

<p>“Which hope we have as an anchor of
the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which
entereth into that within the veil.”</p>

<p>Many a good ship has been lost, not because
her anchors were insufficient and her ground
tackle poor, not because they were not thrown
clear and the ship properly secured to them,
but because the holding ground was bad,&mdash;a
smooth ledge, a soft mud, or loose sand,&mdash;insomuch
that the anchors either slip over or
cut through, and the seaman must perish without
any fault of his own. In other places is
found a soft mud or gravel upon the surface
and beneath a strong clay, into which the
anchor beds itself so sure and steadfast that
no wind or sea will bring it home&mdash;the best
of holding ground. Such anchorages are
highly prized by seafaring men; they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
beat up many a mile to windward to gain
an anchor in them.</p>

<p>Thus the anchor of the soul is both sure
and steadfast, because as the anchor of the
ship goes through the surface mud into the
deep, tenacious clay, it entereth into that
within the veil.</p>

<p>The Holy of Holies, the most sacred place
in the Jewish temple, was concealed by a veil,
which was rent in twain at the crucifixion.
That event was typical of those inward
spiritual truths which are revealed to the
believer by Christ, and in which his hope
consists. The promises of grace and the
inward witness of the spirit that he is an
heir of those promises through faith in Christ
are the holding ground of the believers’
anchor, where once bedded it is sure and
steadfast.</p>

<p>These are inward spiritual joys of which
the believer cannot be deprived except by his
own remissness and the letting down of the
anchor watch. These promises were the
anchor of the apostle’s experience. A rough,
stormy life was his&mdash;almost always on a lee
shore and among the breakers. Very little
smooth water did he see, for in every city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
bonds and imprisonment awaited him; but
he had on board the gospel anchor, and
shackled to it the chain of a rich and deep
experience. The bitter end of that chain was
clinched around the riding bits of his soul;
and he had no fear that the anchor would
come home or the chain part that moored him
to it, and he could say: “O death, where is
thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?”</p>

<p>Life is the sea; the soul is the vessel; the
grace, gifts, and experience of the soul make
up the priceless cargo with which the ship is
freighted. Heaven is the harbor all hope to
make. The temptations, labor, and afflictions
of life are the tempests we must encounter.
It is a stormy sea and a wintry passage. You
need good ground tackle and good holding
ground. Have you them? If not, it is from
negligence, not necessity. It is, my friend,
because you have not bestirred yourself to
take hold of the promises of grace that have
been pressed upon you.</p>

<h3><a name="PRAYER_OFFERED_ON_MEMORIAL_DAY" id="PRAYER_OFFERED_ON_MEMORIAL_DAY"></a>PRAYER OFFERED ON MEMORIAL DAY
(May 30, 1883) AT BRUNSWICK, MAINE</h3>


<p>O Thou who art equally supreme in the moral and
the material universe, guiding the sea-bird to her nest
amid the blinding snows, the breaker’s foam, and the
driving mist of ocean, who makest small the drops of
rain, and a way for the lightning of thunder, and the
thing that is hid bringest forth to light, we adore thy
power and thy wisdom; we magnify thy grace; we
hallow thy name. With penitence we confess our
manifold transgressions as individuals and as a nation.
Holiness belongeth unto Thee, but unto us shame and
confusion of faces.</p>

<p>We thank Thee that Thou didst direct our forefathers
to these shores, and inspire them with purpose
and wisdom to form a civil compact built upon
the principles of religion, education, law, and labor.
We thank Thee that, in the face of famine, pestilence,
and relentless foes, they accomplished their purpose,
and with a spirit of self-sacrifice worthy of the cause,
devoted themselves as stepping stones to bridge the
path of future generations that they might create a
republic, lay the foundations of civil liberty, resist
oppression, and seal their devotion to their principles
with their blood. We thank Thee that though they
have passed away, their principles have survived, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
that when the republic they had reared was rocking
to its foundations, assailed by foes without and treachery
within, their children did not prove unworthy of
the sires who begat them, nor recreant to the principles
they drew in with their mothers’ milk and were
taught at their fathers’ knees. We thank Thee that
they were equally ready to vindicate at the cannon’s
mouth and maintain with property or life the principles
of civil and religious liberty, and the inalienable
right of every man to the fruit of his own labor.</p>

<p>We pray Thee that, on this day, set apart by the
Executive of the nation as a day of grateful remembrance,
we may appreciate the true nature of the
perils we have escaped and acknowledge our indebtedness
to the providence of that Being who ruleth over
the affairs of nations. May we not in our prosperity
forget those dark hours when all faces gathered blackness.
May we not merely decorate the graves, but
may we ever cherish with affectionate remembrance
our obligations to those whose courage mounted in
proportion to the imminence of the danger, and who
approved their loyalty with their blood. May we not
on this day fraught with associations so sad to those
whose wounds, partially healed, are this day reopened,
forget the fatherless whose parents sleep in bloody
graves, and the widows whom this day reminds of all
they have lost, and the aged parents from whom war
took the support of their declining years. We commit
these to thy care and keeping; we commit unto Thee
all those who suffered and sacrificed that the Union
might be preserved. And we thank Thee for the comfort
of a vast army come back from the deadly uproar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
of arms to take up again the unheroic duties of life,
and strive by honest living to maintain the principles
they fought to defend.</p>

<p>We pray for thy blessing upon thy servant. May
he be enabled to expound and enforce those principles
which lie at the foundation of social happiness and
free institutions; those principles which have made
this republic, which a little more than a century ago
was a mere shrub with bare shade sufficient to cover
its roots, to become a tree that hath sent forth its roots
to the sea and its branches to the rivers, and on whose
foliage the sunlight loves to linger, and on whose
branches the dew of heaven lieth all night.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Amen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a><br /><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></span></p>

<p><i>Dear Sirs</i>,&mdash;I have received your note
requesting me to furnish some reminiscences
of Longfellow. I would say in reply that
although yielding to no one in my admiration
of the character and genius of Mr. Longfellow
or regard for his memory, I still feel quite
unable to contribute anything that would
meet your expectations or serve your purpose,
from the fact that my knowledge of
him began and to a large extent closed in very
early youth before his powers had developed.
Nevertheless, as everything even remotely
connected with him or his is valued and
treasured, I will endeavor to comply with
your request.</p>

<p>Hon. Stephen Longfellow, the father of
Henry, was a friend of my father’s and resided
near us. Judge Potter, the father of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
the poet’s first wife, lived almost directly
opposite to us; and in an adjoining house a
sister of the late Eben Steele taught a school
which I attended with two of the daughters
of Judge Potter and other children. The
Potter children, being the nearest neighbors,
were my playmates. I can see them now with
their little blue aprons and happy faces. There
was something very attractive in the expression
of Mary Potter’s features, the future wife
of the poet. It remains as fresh in my recollection
to-day as it was then. I used to hear
a great deal about angels, but cherished very
incoherent ideas in regard to them, and one
evening when my mother was teaching me a
hymn, the conclusion of which was:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">“May angels guard me while I sleep</div>
    <div class="verse">Till morning light appears,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I astonished her by asking if Mary Potter was
not an angel.</p>

<p>Though she was quiet and retiring, it made
one happy to be in her society; and she enjoyed
fun as well as the rest of us, only in a
more quiet way. One morning there was a
platform laid around the pump in the schoolyard
and a man employed to paint it red. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
going to dinner he put his paint-pot and brush
under the edge of the platform where we discovered
it. The Potters wore red morocco
shoes and I wore black ones. Some other
children who rejoiced in red shoes were very
proud of them, which excited my envy. I
painted my own and the shoes of several
others a staring red, and we strutted among
our mates with great satisfaction, which, however,
was somewhat abated upon the arrival
of the schoolmistress.</p>

<p>It was the custom at that time in Portland
to send children to the Academy very soon
after leaving the primary school, and there I
first met Henry Longfellow; but he was a
large boy fitting for college, and I was a little
one. I can therefore only give you the impression
made (by his habits and bearing) upon
the mind of a boisterous boy who had with
him nothing in common. But I recollect perfectly
the impression made upon myself and
others by his deportment, and from these impressions
draw the inferences I communicate.
He was a very handsome boy, retiring without
being reserved; there was no chill in his manners.
There was a frankness about him that
won you at once; he looked you square in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
face. His eyes were full of expression, and it
seemed as if you could look down into them as
into a clear spring. There were many rough
boys in the school, a great deal of horse-play
and a good many rough-and-tumble games at
recess, and the boys who were not inclined
to engage in them often excited the ill-will of
their ruder mates who were prone to imagine
that the former felt above them. As a result
the quiet boys sometimes fell victims to this
feeling and were dragged out and rudely
treated. But no one ever thought of taking
such liberties with Longfellow, nor did such
suspicions ever attach to him. Not even John
Bartels or John Goddard ever meddled with
him. I think John Goddard expressed the
common sentiment of the school when, after
some boy had remarked upon Longfellow’s
retiring habits, he exclaimed: “Oh, let him
alone. He don’t belong to our breed of cats.”
He had no relish for rude sports, but he loved
to bathe in a little creek on the border of
Deering’s Oaks. And he would sometimes
tramp through the woods with a gun; but
this was mostly through the influence of
others. He loved much better to lie under a
tree and read. Small boys think it a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
affair to tag after larger ones, especially if the
larger ones carry guns, and I have often
picked up the dead squirrels that he and
others used to shoot in the oaks. And he and
John Kinsman or Edward Preble would boost
me into a tree to shake off acorns for them.</p>

<p>His early associations were very strong, and
as is the fact in respect to most of us, they
strengthened with age and cropped out everywhere
in his verse. One familiar with the
scenes and events of his youth can readily
trace to their source the allusions in many
of his verses. It was doubtless after gathering
the mayflower on some half-holiday or
tramping through the woods that, as he lay
beneath some one of those old oaks on the
verge of the forest, with limbs thirty feet in
length within reach of the hand, and looked
up through the branches and watched the
clouds go by, he received those impressions
which took form in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">“Pleasant it was when woods were green</div>
    <div class="verse">And winds were soft and low,</div>
    <div class="verse">To lie amid some sylvan scene,</div>
    <div class="verse">Where the long drooping boughs between</div>
    <div class="verse">Shadows dark and sunlight sheen</div>
    <div class="verse">Alternate come and go.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<p>Though Longfellow was a thoughtful, he
certainly was not a melancholy boy, and the
minor key to which so much of his verse is
attuned, and that tinge of sadness which his
countenance wore in later years, were due to
that first great sorrow which came upon him
in the loss of her to whom I have referred,
and which was chiselled still deeper by subsequent
trials. He never buried her, and that
beautiful tribute to her memory in the “Footsteps
of Angels” is as true as tender.</p>

<p>He was ever ready to extend a helping
hand to others. After leaving school we
took different paths and never met again till
1870, when I received a communication from
him through Mr. James T. Fields, saying that
he had kept run of me and wished me to call
upon him at a time fixed by him. I went and
was most cordially received. I asked him how
he had kept run of me. He replied through
his brother Alexander, his sister Mrs. Pierce,
and Mr. James Greenleaf, his brother-in-law,
an intimate friend and later schoolmate of
mine. We reviewed the past, and almost the
first question he asked in relation to it was
about the scholars in that Academy, and he
mentioned almost every name but the one I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
knew was most dear to him. This is what
led me to say that he never buried her.</p>

<p>But what a change in that care-worn face,
marked with the deep lines of thought and
sorrow, from the smooth-cheeked boy of my
early recollections, unconscious of care and to
whom the future was rainbow tinted and full
of hope. The eyes, however, had not lost their
wonted expression, and the same sweet smile
was on his lips, and he encouraged me in the
kindest manner to continue in the course I
had just then commenced, in words that it
does not become me to repeat, but which will
never be forgotten. And from that time to
his death I found that neither success nor sorrow
had narrowed the sympathies or chilled
the heart of Henry Longfellow.</p>

<h3><a name="BEN_BOLT" id="BEN_BOLT"></a>BEN BOLT</h3>


<p>Some time since, in the story of a wasted
life, we depicted the results of intemperance
and the terrible grasp which this vice fastens
upon its victims, alas, but seldom broken.
Lest our young readers should be left to imagine
that reformation is hopeless, we will
relate the story of Ben Bolt.</p>

<p>Ben Bolt was an English sailor about forty
years of age, and a very powerful man, of an
iron frame and constitution and a choice man
on board ship. He was withal intelligent,
having received a good common school education,
and of most excellent disposition even
when in liquor. He was honest as the sun,
was never known to back out of a ship, cheat
his landlord, or run away after getting his
month’s advance. Ben was an excellent
singer, and obtained his name from a song
called “Ben Bolt,” that he was very fond of
singing. What his real appellation was, for
many years I did not know. He had none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
of the vices common to seamen except drinking,
and that he had to perfection, insomuch
that he was seldom sober while on shore.</p>

<p>I was conscious of a singular attraction
towards Ben; I liked him; and whenever I
could catch him comparatively sober, endeavored
to wean him from his cups. Sailors
are, in general, inclined to relate incidents
of their life, and if they have religious or
well-to-do parents, to speak of them with satisfaction
and honest pride. Ben, however,
was reticent in this respect.</p>

<p>One day I was sitting at an open window
in the reading room of the Sailors’ Home, and
Ben was seated on the piazza outside singing
a psalm in a low tone; at the conclusion he
turned, and seeing me, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Parson, I’ve sung that psalm many times
in the parish church at home.”</p>

<p>Then, as though afraid I might pursue the
subject further, abruptly left. I judged from
this that during his youth he might have sung
in the church choir; at any rate he could read
music, had a thorough knowledge of it, and
was a skilful player on the violin.</p>

<p>There were two hundred grog shops within
a short distance of the Home, several within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
three or four rods of the door, and every inducement
was held out to encourage seamen
to drink. Ben had shipped for New Orleans,
but when the hour came for the vessel to sail,
he was missing. The superintendent of the
Home told the “runners” to go to Ben’s room,
get a key, open his chest, and see if he had
got his outfit of sea-clothes and was ready to
go, and if so, to search among the grog shops
and find him; but if he had not got his outfit,
he would take a man who was ready and put
Ben in another vessel.</p>

<p>I happened to be in the entry when they
came upstairs, and went into the room with
them. They opened the chest, and there were
his oil clothes, sea-boots, woollens, and every
part of his outfit, and stowed snugly away
among the flannels a two-gallon jug of whiskey.
One of the “runners” took it and was
about to pour the liquor out of the window,
but I interfered, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“You have no right to pour his liquor out;
he bought it and paid for it and worked hard
to earn the money.”</p>

<p>“It is against the rules of the house to
bring liquor into it.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is here now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

<p>“When he goes aboard, the mate of that
ship will throw it overboard. The last time
he went from here he carried a jug, and the
mate of the ship took all their liquor away,
for every man in the forecastle had a jug.”</p>

<p>“Well, the mate can do as he likes, but
you shan’t pour it out.”</p>

<p>I put the jug back and sat down on the
chest to wait for Ben. The “runners” did
not succeed in finding him at his usual haunts,
and, as time was pressing, another man was
taken and Ben left behind. I knew he had
a noble spirit of his own, and that taking
liquor from him by force had accomplished
nothing in the past, and I resolved to make
an effort in another direction. I had some
temperance tracts, written by the boatswain of
an English man-of-war, discussing the evils
of intemperance from the sailor’s standpoint,
which I knew had produced impressions upon
many sailors. I spread one of these over the
jug, then took a Bible and opened to the
twenty-ninth verse of the twenty-third chapter
of Proverbs, locked the chest, and went away.</p>

<p>The doors of the Home were locked at
twelve o’clock, and those who were not in by
that time must stay out. Ben came home, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
the watchman told me, about ten minutes
before twelve pretty decidedly drunk. Finding
himself safe in his room, he concluded as
he was not going in the ship, and didn’t need
the whiskey to carry to sea, he would have
a good drink and turn in. Opening the chest,
he saw the tract and read it, espied the Bible
and read that, the result of which was that he
turned in without tasting the whiskey. When
he waked in the morning, he read the tract
again, then took the jug, turned the liquor
out of the window, and broke the vessel on
the window-sill. At breakfast he told the “runners” what he had done. Upon this
they told him of what had taken place the
previous afternoon, and who had placed the
tracts and Bible in his chest beside the rum
jug. He then came into my room, the tears
on his cheeks, exclaiming:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Parson, you wouldn’t let ’em pour out my
whiskey.”</p>

<p>“No, Ben.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve poured it out and broke the
jug, and so help me God not another drop of
whiskey shall pass my lips. Rum and I have
fell out. There’s two kinds of drunk, being
drunk in the head and in the legs. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
drunk in the legs last night; I had all I
could do to get upstairs, but my head was
clear enough to read that tract and take the
sense of it. The boatswain of that man-of-war
talks well ’cause he talks from experience.
I also read the Good Book and took the sense
of that. I went to the “runners,” and they
told me you wouldn’t let ’em pour out the
whiskey. Ah, that took hold. I knew it
wasn’t ’cause you wanted me to drink liquor
that you wouldn’t let ’em pour it out. I
knew you was a bitter enemy to liquor, but a
good friend to the man who drinks it. Don’t
think I’ve forgotten all the good words you’ve
said to me during the four or five years I’ve
been knocking about this house drunk. I’ve
thought of ’em in the middle watch at sea
when I was myself. I’ve thought of these
bloodsuckers round this house trying to get
my money away from me, to take the clothes
off my back and the shoes off my feet, and
you trying to get me out of their clutches
and save my soul; and I’ve thought if ever
I got ashore again, I’d ship in with you and
sign the articles, and now I am going to do
it.”</p>

<p>“Are you really determined to leave off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
drinking, or is it a mere impulse of the
moment?”</p>

<p>“I never was more resolved to get drunk
when I had come off a long voyage than I
now am to keep sober.”</p>

<p>“You cannot do this in your own strength.
I have known hundreds attempt it and fail;
you do not, cannot realize the struggle it will
cost. Let us ask help of God.”</p>

<p>We knelt down together. When I had
finished, I asked him to pray; he said he
could not.</p>

<p>“Then repeat the Lord’s Prayer with me;
we are together in this thing and must both
have our hands on the rope.” He did so,
and added to it,” God, be merciful to me
a sinner.”</p>

<p>“Your appetites and passions, Ben, have
got you under their feet, and you must have
help outside of yourself; so long as you seek
it where we have sought it together this morning
you will succeed.”</p>

<p>The next week he shipped for Australia.
For five years I had seen him go from the
house on different voyages, and he had always
gone so intoxicated as to be barely able to sit
in the wagon and unable to get aboard without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
help. The captain or mate would often say to
the “runners”:&mdash;</p>

<p>“What did you bring that drunken fellow
here for? I was to have good men from
your place.” And the invariable reply would
be:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Captain, he will be the best man in the
ship when the rum’s out of him. He’s a bully
man.”</p>

<p>This time he went aboard sober and fit for
any duty, and came home as second mate of
the ship. He was no longer Ben Bolt, but
men who had been in the ship with him and
whom he brought to the Home, called him Mr.
Adams, William Adams.</p>

<p>Note these two characters so strikingly different
in circumstances and in results.</p>

<p>George L., spoken of in “A Wasted Life,”
after several struggles for victory over appetite,
yielded and died by his own hand. William
Adams conquered, continued steadfast through
life, and accumulated property. George L. had
youth on his side, a mother’s affection and
many kind friends to encourage him, and he
made shipwreck. Adams at forty years of age
was a confirmed drunkard, all his associates
were in the practice of the same vice, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
leagued together to drag him back, and with
but one friend to take him by the hand and
encourage him to a better course. George L.
had a home, his flute, books, and steady employment.
He could attend lectures, find innocent
amusement, and good society. Adams
was in the narrow compass of a ship’s forecastle,
where all the conversation among his
shipmates was in respect to the debauchery
they had practised while on shore and meant
to practise again at the first opportunity.
George L., if he had been so minded, could
have turned down the next street and got
clear of his evil companions, but Adams could
not, and when the vessel arrived in a foreign
port, and the crew had money given them and
liberty to go ashore, the pressure was terrible.
You may say, he could stay on board and let
them go; so he did. But if you think this
was an easy matter for a person of his previous
habits, all I can say is, you don’t know
what sailors are, and are entirely incapable of
forming any conception of the strength of that
instinct which leads a sailor to go with his
shipmates either in good or evil. We talk
about the strength of the college tie; the
college tie is a spider’s web in the contrast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p>

<p>Why, I have frequently known the whole
watch in a crew of men who had just come
off a long voyage to insist on sleeping in the
same room, three in a bed, and the rest on
the floor, because they had been so long together
in the forecastle in the same watch;
but after three or four nights they would
pair off and take rooms two together.</p>

<p>All these trials, temptations, and discouragements
Adams met and surmounted. I attribute
the failure of George L. to the fact
that he trusted in himself, and the success
of Adams to the fact that he went out of
himself at the very outset, went to God for
aid. In his case it was the moral force supplementing
the will that had become well-nigh
powerless which decided a contest in
which character, consideration, and happiness
both here and hereafter, were at stake.
All the talk at present is about forces of
various kinds; but if a young man would
have real force of character and wage a
successful contest, let him seek for it where
William Adams sought and found.</p>

<h3><a name="MAAM_PRICE" id="MAAM_PRICE"></a>MA’AM PRICE</h3>


<p>A notable woman was Ma’am Price who
taught school in Portland, Maine; and Polly,
her daughter, was a spunky piece and was
ready with an answer to anybody. The
schoolroom was in Ma’am Price’s own house
that stood in Turkey Lane, so called from
the following circumstance: Mr.&mdash;&mdash;, who
lived in that locality, invited the Reverend
Samuel Deane to dine with him and partake
of a turkey. The parson coming according
to appointment found a Cape Cod turkey on
the table,&mdash;a boiled salt fish. Notwithstanding
the town christened the lane Newburg
Street, the name Turkey Lane clave to the
spot more than forty years.</p>

<p>When the British destroyed the town,
Turkey Lane was directly in range of the
enemy’s fire; and when Ma’am Price had
removed her household stuff to a place of
safety, Polly resolved to save her pig. A sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>-captain
who had assisted her advised her to
turn the animal out to shift for itself, as
Mowatt had opened fire, and it was not
worth while to risk life to save a pig that
was not likely to be hit by a cannon-ball.
Polly, however, fastened a string to the
creature’s leg and undertook to drive it a
long mile to Bramhall’s Hill. The pig was
obstinate, Polly determined, the progress
necessarily slow. Meanwhile shells were
bursting and flinging the dirt on Polly. One
junk of earth struck the stick from her hand,
and red-hot cannon-balls were whirring around
her, but Polly was determined to save the pig,
and save it she did.</p>

<p>Ma’am Price came to Portland from one of
the West India Islands. She was a woman
of culture, but very decided and strict in
school discipline. If a boy refused to hold
his head up, she fastened a fork under his
chin. No trifling with her.</p>

<p>Some years after this she was obliged to suspend
her school on account of an alarm of smallpox.
A number of her scholars, among whom
were my mother and uncles, were inoculated
with smallpox virus, put in a pesthouse, and
Ma’am Price, in whose experience and judg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>ment
the parents reposed the greatest confidence,
employed to take care of them.</p>

<p>It was customary, before the discovery of
Jenner, to inoculate with smallpox matter;
but the patients being first put under a strict
régime and properly and seasonably cared
for, the disorder was not much more severe
than varioloid. It was seldom that a patient
died or was even pitted.</p>

<p>These young persons had been long kept
on water gruel and were convalescent, when
Hugh McLellan, by aid of friends outside,
procured two lobsters. The whole company
were around the table about to partake, when
Ma’am Price made her appearance, and forbade
them to take a mouthful, saying it
would kill them. They were, however, resolved
to eat, live or die. When unable to
prevent them, for the boys were large, she
took out her box that was filled full of yellow
Scotch snuff, strewed it over the fish, and
stirred it in with a spoon. Though provoked
enough at the moment, they cherished no ill-will
against her; at least I think not, when
I recollect the number of presents the boys
and girls, whose parents were Ma’am Price’s
scholars, used to carry to Turkey Lane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p>The good lady’s house was a great resort
for captains of vessels, with whom her husband
had been acquainted in the West Indies,
and who brought her a great many presents,&mdash;fruit,
shells, coral, eyestones, and vanilla
beans. People who got anything in the eye
would go to her to have an eyestone put in,
and the old ladies went there for sweet-scented
beans to put in their snuff-boxes.</p>

<p>We were everlastingly teasing to carry some
present to Ma’am Price, and we found our
account in so doing. She would put the
eyestones in a saucer and pour in vinegar,
when they would crawl all over the saucer.
She would show us old pictures, needlework,
and beautiful shells, and tell us stories about
the West Indies and the pirates. And always
when we carried a present, she gave us tamarind
or guava jelly, or some West India fruit.</p>

<p>There was one fellow who thought&mdash;though
doubtless it was just his silly notion&mdash;that the
boy who carried the most acceptable present
received the largest share of sweetmeats. So
one time when he was going to the good
woman’s with several other boys, and all he
had to carry was a plate of doughnuts, while
one of the others had a fifteen-pound turkey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
he told that boy if he would present the
doughnuts and let him present the turkey,
he would give him two flounder hooks and
a gray squirrel; thus they swapped. We
all thought the other boy rather regretted
it when going home, but he regretted it a
good deal more about a week after when
Ma’am Price came to call on their respective
mothers and thanked his mother for “the
nice plate of doughnuts” she sent her.
Ma’am Price was very punctual and particular
in returning her acknowledgments, and
she did it like Britannia stooping to conquer.</p>

<p>I am now going to tell the most wonderful
thing that ever happened to this excellent
woman. One forenoon during recess she
went into her little garden, picked a mess
of beans in her apron, sat down in the schoolroom
to shell them, and shelled out three
diamonds. What a talk it did make! People
came from all the towns round to hear
the story and look at “the diamonds that
grew in a bean pod.”</p>

<p>I hear some boy say, “That never could
be; diamonds couldn’t grow in a bean pod.”
I have quoted that as town talk, and Ma’am
Price and Polly always thought they grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
there. I believe, moreover, that she shelled
them out of a bean pod; I shall stick to
that. It’s not the least use for you to tell
me she didn’t. Mrs. Commodore Preble saw
her with her own eyes shell them out, and so
did Mrs. Matthew Cobb who lived in the
cottage on the eastern corner of High and
Free streets. My mother said she did, and
Mrs. James Deering said so too. Now, then,
that’s not all. The very day before the old
lady died Miss Sarah Jewett said to her: “Ma’am Price, did you truly shell those diamonds
out of a bean pod? Hadn’t the pod
been opened, or was it solid together like
the other pods?”</p>

<p>“Bless you, Miss Jewett, how could I tell?
You know folks don’t look at every bean or
pea they shell, except there’s one that won’t
open right. I was shelling away and looking
at the children to see that they were all in
their seats, when I felt something hard under
my thumb and looked into my lap, and there
were two little shining things among the
beans, and another rolled out of the pod
under my thumb when I took it up.”</p>

<p>Miss Jewett had one of the stones set in a
ring that is now in the possession of William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
Gould of Windham. John Campbell, a relative
of Polly’s, has another, and where the
third is I do not know.</p>

<p>Whenever the children carried Ma’am Price
a present, she would take the diamonds out
of a cotton in which they were kept, lay them
in her lap, and let the children handle them;
after which she would tell how she shelled
them out of the bean pod, and how surprised
she was.</p>

<p>I suppose if I don’t try to explain this
mystery, I shall have forty letters from boys
inquiring how those diamonds came there.
Well, my father said that a vessel came to
Portland from Brazil, on board of which were
several kinds of precious stones. The mate
of the vessel was paying attention to Polly,
and he stole them out of the cargo and put
them in the bean. He dared not give them
to Polly nor tell her about it because he stole
them; but as they had only about a dozen
bean vines, he knew she or her mother would
find them after the vessel was gone, so he put
them in the pod just as he was about to sail.
The vessel was never heard from, and thus
he never came back to claim Polly nor to
tell her where the diamonds, which were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
of any great value, came from, and Polly
always thought they grew in the pod. This
was my father’s solution of the mystery which
made considerable of a stir at the time. As
he knew all the parties and circumstances
thoroughly, it seems the most probable explanation;
for nobody ever doubted that Ma’am
Price took them from the bean pod, and there
were not many that believed they grew there,
though some did and looked at it in the light
of a special providence and provision for a
worthy woman; the objections to which are
that, though diamonds, they were rough diamonds,
not much more valuable than quartz,
and that Providence provided abundantly for
the good woman in the affections of her scholars,
who never suffered her to lack any comfort
in her old age.</p>

<p>If Ma’am Price was severe in her management
of scholars, she was not more so than
the parents themselves, as the following anecdote
will show. Captain Joseph McLellan had
a thermometer, rather a rare thing in those
days. His wife went to meeting one Sunday,
leaving the boys, Joe and Stephen, at home.
Stephen held the bulb of the thermometer
to the fire to see the mercury rise, and by so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
doing broke it. They were well aware of the
consequences. Joe told Stephen if he would
give him fifty cents, he would tell his mother
that he broke it and take the whipping, which
he did. The next day the mother found out
the true state of the case and whipped them
both, Stephen for breaking the instrument,
and Joe for telling a lie. These were the
kind of women to handle unruly boys when
the father was at sea.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_DISCONTENTED_BROOK" id="THE_DISCONTENTED_BROOK"></a>THE DISCONTENTED BROOK</h3>

<p class="center">A DIALOGUE</p>


<p>In a province of Old Spain respecting which
the inhabitants were wont to say that God had
given them a fertile soil, a salubrious climate,
brave men, and beautiful women, but He had
not given them a good government lest they
should not be willing to die and go to heaven,
there were two lakes separated by an intervening
mountain. Each had an outlet in a
brook; and the two brooks, as they wound
among the hills, ran near each other, so that
they were enabled to converse together quite
socially. They lay in the shadow of the hills
among whose roots rose the river Guadalquiver.
The chain sloped by degrees to a
fertile plain covered with vineyards and olive
trees. Fields of wheat surrounded the scattered
dwellings of the peasants and the tents
of shepherds whose flocks fed upon the moun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>tains.
The names of the brooks were Bono
and Malo.</p>

<p>One pleasant night at the close of a very
sultry day they met to pass the evening together;
so, getting into a little eddy beneath
the shade of some large chestnut trees, where
the moonbeams which glanced tremulously
through the foliage enabled them to see each
other’s faces indistinctly, they thus spake in
murmurs.</p>

<p><i>Bono.</i> “What a beautiful evening, neighbor
Malo, after such a sultry day! Yet I don’t
know as I ought to speak ill of the weather,
for it has enabled me to do much good, to
water many beautiful flowers and fields of
grain that otherwise would have perished.”</p>

<p><i>Malo.</i> “I don’t know about that. Who
thanked you for it? I have been this whole
day,&mdash;yes, for the matter of that, my whole
life,&mdash;running first here, then there, squeezed
in flumes, tangled in water-wheels, pounded
in fulling mills, flung over precipices till my
neck was well-nigh broken. Again, I am
kept broiling in the sun, and if I steal for a
moment into the shade, I cannot stay there.
I have almost boiled to-day journeying among
hot rocks and over burning sands. And what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
thanks have I got for it? Do you know,
neighbor Bono, the old peasant Alva?”</p>

<p><i>Bono.</i> “Has he a daughter Lenore? Is
his cottage shaded by two large cork trees?
And is there a field of saffron between his
house and the mill?”</p>

<p><i>Malo.</i> “Just so.”</p>

<p><i>Bono.</i> “I have known him these many
years. His daughter keeps a few sheep and
goats on the mountain and often drives them
to my waters.”</p>

<p><i>Malo.</i> “Well, only think! the old churl has
been hoeing this morning among his saffron;
so at noon he comes to me and goes down on
his hands and knees to drink. Then he says,
‘I’ll bathe.’ So he bathes and, without saying
as much as ’By your leave’ or ’God is good’
or anything of the sort, just puts on his
clothes and walks off. Yet I have watered
his fields and those of his ancestors for a
thousand years, have often kept them from
starving, and not one of them ever gave me
even a look of gratitude. But I am resolved
to do so no more. I won’t wear out my life
for those who give me no thanks. I mean in
the future to keep my waters to myself and to
water no one but myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bono.</i> “Well, neighbor Malo,” replies Bono,
with a murmur so sweet that the nightingale
who was saying her evening prayers in the
almond tree stopped to listen, “I cannot feel
as you do, neither do I wish to. I have, indeed,
had some weary times, especially, as you
say, to-day, and sometimes have been almost
dried up. But I know what my duty is; God
made me to water the earth and the plants.
It would be pleasant to receive gratitude, but
if we cannot have that, there is one thing we
can always have,&mdash;the happiness of feeling
that we have done our duty.”</p>

<p><i>Malo.</i> “Duty! This is fine talking, but I
heed it no more than the song of that nightingale.
What duty do I owe to that old
peasant or any of his kin? To the earth or
the plants? What good have they ever done
me?”</p>

<p><i>Bono.</i> “But, neighbor Malo, the duty I
speak of is not to them but to God. I have,
as you very well know, turned the mills of
Henrique these forty years, and also the fulling
mills of Gonzalez, his nephew. As I said
before, this old Alva’s daughter, who used you
so scurvily, both waters and washes her sheep
in my stream. Not one of these people ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
thanked me; yet I love very much to see
their sheep fat, their lambs frisking on the
hills, and their families thriving. I indeed
enjoy their happiness as though it were my
own.”</p>

<p><i>Malo.</i> “By this crouching spirit you invite
insult and aggression.”</p>

<p><i>Bono.</i> “But are we not as well off in this
respect as our neighbors? The earth bringeth
not forth fruit for itself; the ocean shares not
in the profits of the voyage. Who thanks the
patient ox for dragging the plough all his life?
The sheep gives her fleece to clothe them and
then has her throat cut and her skin pulled
over her ears, and not so much as ’Thank you’
or ’By your leave’ to it all. You and I have
not thanked God for this pleasant moonlight,
this sweet shade, and these flowers that perfume
our banks. He, without any thanks,
causes ’his sun to rise on the evil and on the
good and sendeth rain on the just and on the
unjust.’ Surely then we, His instruments,
ought not to complain who are so forgetful
ourselves.”</p>

<p><i>Malo.</i> “You are a very noisy brook as
everybody knows, but I am determined to
take care of myself. I shall go home and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
stay at home. And you, who are as full of
Scripture as a brook is of pebbles, ought to
know that charity begins at home.”</p>

<p><i>Bono.</i> “True, but it does not stay there.
I shall be sorry to lose your company; we
have run together so long, but if you are
resolved to benefit only yourself, I am just as
firmly resolved to benefit others; yes, the last
drop&mdash;I will share even that with the faint
and the thirsty.”</p>

<p>Thus Bono went on overflowing with kindness
the whole world. The good brook ran
among the vineyards, and the grapes hung in
rich clusters; it ran through the fields, and
the grass turned to deeper green; the trees
said, “He waters us; let us shadow him.”
The great oaks and sycamores bent kindly
over the brook, and their branches screened it
from the heat of the sun. The shepherds
often wanted wood, but they said: “Let us not
cut down the trees that shade the brook, for it
is a good brook. It turns our mills and waters
our fields and flocks. God be thanked for
the running water!” Thus the brook that
worked for everybody was loved and protected.
It grew larger and ran in the Guadalquiver,
and there helped to water larger fields and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
turn larger machinery; it ran to the ocean
and foamed beneath the keel of mighty ships
and was diffused over the whole universe of
God. It sent up so many vapors to heaven
that they returned in plentiful showers bringing
back more than they carried. Thus the
brook that watered, not expecting any thanks
or profit, but because it was duty, was loved
and blessed.</p>

<p>But how fared it with Malo who had retired
into himself to take care of himself and left
his channel dry and dusty? For a while he
had more water than he knew what to do
with. He was obliged to work night and day
raising his banks to keep it in. He labored a
great deal harder to keep the waters from
breaking out and doing good to some one,
watering some poor man’s perishing crops,
than he ever did before in watering and
fertilizing a whole province. Meanwhile, in
the plains below, the grass withered, the mill
stopped, the flocks died, the shepherds cursed
the brook, and some of them cursed God.
But Malo said: “Let them curse. I’m for
myself. I’ve water enough.” But by and
by a fire at which some shepherds were cooking
their dinner got away from them, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
wind being high ran up the dry bed of the
brook in the withered grass and dry leaves,
and burnt up the forest on the sides of the
hill that fed the pond and all the trees that
shaded it. The sun, then pouring in with
meridian heat, began to shrink the waters.
There being little motion in them since they
had ceased to run, they putrefied and the fish
perished. Snakes, lizards, and all vile creatures
came to live there. Instead of flowers
and foliage, bullrushes, reeds, and the deadly
aconite grew there. As the waters grew less
and less fewer vapors went up from it and
less rain came down. After a while it mantled
over with a green scum, and malaria
began to rise from it. People began to die
in the neighborhood; malaria got among the
soldiers in a garrison near by, and the doctors
said, “It is the pond; it must be drained.”
Then all the country round about and the soldiers
came together and drained it dry, and
brought down earth and rocks from the
mountain, and filled up the bed of the
lake that there might be no more stagnant
water.</p>

<p>Thus it fell out to the brook that was determined
to benefit only itself. It lost all. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
had both God and man to fight against. For
if men are not always grateful, they are not
often slack in repaying injuries. Let us follow
the example of the industrious brook, and
by it learn in blessing to be blessed.</p>

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
